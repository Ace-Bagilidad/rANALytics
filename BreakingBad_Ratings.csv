10,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it."
10,"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!"
10,"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
10,Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!
10,"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."
10,I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen.
10,"If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic."
10,Re-Watched it 7 times and counting. I guess I liked it.
10,"Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u)."
10,Direction- PERFECT!!Screenplay-PERFECT!!Writing-PERFECT!!Score-PERFECT!!Cinematography-PERFECT!!Casting-PERFECT!!Beginning-PERFECT!!Climax-PERFECT!!Acting-BEYOND PERFECT!!Overall-(as I said) ABSOLUTE PERFECTION.
10,"This serie is unique. This is somehow realistic and amazing also. Even if you're going to watch for find the flaws, I bet you can't find real major flaws in this serie. You know some people are just tries to find nonsense things in contents. (I mean in a movie or TV show) They are hard to pleased but even those people can enjoy this serie, because they really can't find one easily.I don't know how Vince Gilligan think this serie. It is real complicated and amazing story. He's a true genius that deserves so much more. He shared the golden age of TV Shows with Game of Thrones. It is best crime, drama TV series possible. And it ended with the best way possible.The actings are quite remarkable. I don't know how we were'nt know the name Bryan Cranston, I don't know how he didn't became a big star before this show. Giancarlo Esposito, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn Jonathan Bakns and Bob Odenkirk is also pretty amazing. Nearly all cast did a perfect job.Cinematography is so good in this serie. Not only looks great but also brings realistic style with that shaking camera sequences. You feel the moment with silence.Costume Design is also underrated. Did you know that characters has his own colors that reflects his personality? I know, it isn't a secret, many people know that but it really is something great.Also makeups are pretty good, did you know Bryan Cranston had hair when he's bald? Yes there was hair behind that. I know it's not that hard thing to do, It's not magic. But also wounded characters are too realistic. Especially Jesse's wounded face."
10,"BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite ""Must See"", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series."
10,"It's hard for me to be super objective about this show. Over the course of 62 episodes, right from the start, for me, Vince Gilligan and his team of writers and directors crafted a piece of neo-noir-western American tragedy that almost never, if ever, lost its footing. In its story of the rise and fall of Walter White (or his fun alias Heisenberg) and how he becomes a Meth ""Emperor"" in Albuquerque during his run of lung cancer, we get all kinds of dramaturgy here. There's conflict, conflict, conflict going on in this show, always, from the familial (what do I tell my wife, Skylar, or not tell her, what doesn't she tell me, how far do the lies and deceit and horrors go?) to the more genre-leaning (how much criminals go in their crazy s***, which is established early on with the throw of the particular chemical and the ""This... is not Meth"" explosion) to the dark comedy that gives the Coens a run for their money (Better Call Saul!) - not to mention how it made Aaron Paul just as much as star as Bryan Cranston, both working actors along with Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt and Bob Odenkirk. It all... fits.Often with a show it's easy to let things slip, even (or especially) on the great shows when it comes to character dynamics, repetition, things that can be hard to control over the space of such a long period of time. But everything is so carefully mapped out, season after season, for the unpredictable to keep happening and for the dramatic beats to gain tension and mystery. Just take how the writers set up, so patiently, over a season, the opening clues of objects and debris all outside of a house, and when you finally find out what all this is about - BAM right to the gut.What one comes away with, outside of the tremendous performances (you might gripe that Cranston got too many Emmys, but... what didn't he deserve with every fiber of his acting bad-assery?) and the consequences that are built up for all the characters, including those we think are made of rock and steel (Mike Erhmantraut), is the world of moral terror. What is morality in this world? There isn't any. It's the Wild West, but crossed with something like, I dunno, American Beauty. What happens when you take a hardcore drug-gangster tale of suspense and warp it with dark comedy about what it means to be a man in society today, or what it means to have a family (and believe me, there are many moments that are downright haunting, harrowing to the soul that speak to this, especially as it builds and builds in its last eight episodes)? You get... this. Perfection.I wish I could tell you there's problems with the show, but rarely can I find any. I'm sure if I dug deep enough some might be there, a cliché exploited for the drug-war scenarios or having a baby around for easy drama or theatrics. But so many times on this show you - or I should say I - get thrown curve balls that really have no other way of working out except how they do. When a moment like Walter White in his crawl space discovering a terrible revelation and going from agony to abhorrent laughter arrives, it's just one of those amazing moments of drama in any American medium. It might be throwing praise like gravy on a Thanksgiving platter, but I'm reminded of Nicholson's comment once on Kubrick: everyone acknowledges he's the man, and I still think that underrates him."
10,"The best series I have seen in my whole life, even better than the wire."
10,"Where do I even begin? The writing is near perfect, the actors and characters are all amazing, the over-arching story just gets only better and better. This show is just a bullet train, this just goes and refuses to stop. It pulls no punches, everything that happens has all the impact. And honestly, there isn't a single bad episode. Every episode, yes even ""Fly"", serves a purpose, and honestly, shouldn't be skipped over upon first viewing. And for a show that ended in 2013, it's still relatively popular and beloved among people. Everyone I know still loves the show and loves it to death.There isn't much else to say, other than that this show is perfect. 10/10."
10,When you finish the show you'll never be the same..I guarantee you
10,"Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: ""No thank you"" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see ""Breaking Bad"" again. I can't wait."
10,I wanna delete my brain and watch it again like I never knew it.
10,"I wish I'd never seen it so I could see it for the first time again.It's the story of an underappreciated chemistry teacher with terminal cancer who decides to ""break bad"" and get into the drug business to ostensibly make a quick buck for the sake of his dependent family before kicking the bucket.But of course things aren't so simple. Even though Walter is a scientific genius and has most of the answers, he doesn't have all of them. On top of that, things aren't so easy as they look.Even at face value, this plot is compelling and the product does not disappoint in that regard. This is a substantial work in the action genre with superbly directed scenes of violence and rage.Yet the deeper level may be what takes Breaking Bad to the highest pinnacle of art. The series is marked by unparalleled intricacy in its characters dipped into this simple premise that would make quite an adventure on its own merits. Even characters which would usually be neglected, like Skylar, Walter's housewife spouse, is a tower of complexity. Her motivations, urges, and errors lead to dire consequences for others even though such a character as pregnant suburban middle class homemaker in work of realism would initially appear powerless.Over the course of the series, this intricacy of the characters coalesces into one of the finest works of tragedy in fiction. Hamartia in the form of excessive ambition, pride, or commitment combine with the simple truth that things aren't as clear cut as they appear at face value to lead to truly powerful scenes and explosive conclusions.A frank and mature exploration on the meaning of love, life, family, loyalty, and so much more.Not to be missed."
10,"PERFECTSeason 1: 8 stars. Too awesome (3 viewings)Season 2: 9 stars. Amazing (3 viewings)Season 3: 9 stars. (3 viewings)Season 4: 10 stars. (3 viewings)Season 5: 10 stars. Perfection at its finest. So smart. So amazing. Best show ever. (first half - 3 viewings, second half - 2 viewings)"
10,"Often hailed as one of the greatest TV ever made, Breaking Bad lives up to the hype. You will be hard pressed to watch a show that is as well shot, directed, acted, and written. Being a finite series, the story told feels complete, compelling, and doesn't drag out into unnecessary and disappointing filler episodes. Every minute of this series is masterfully crafted and designed to encapsulate the viewer into a once in a lifetime experience. Instantly becoming a classic must-watch show, I cannot name anything that I would have wanted different. If you haven't yet seen it, you've been missing out and I hope you take the time to experience such a perfect show."
10,"Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show of all time, and you can tell very easily because it's lowest rated episode has a score of 7.8. There are few other shows that can come close to the level of Breaking Bad, and one of them is it's own spin-off show, Better Call Saul. No other show in television history has had as long as a powerful and lasting impact on human culture, not even the longest running shows of all time, not The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Law & Order, SpongeBob SquarePants.Breaking Bad may have the greatest cinematography on television and the acting is an astonishing compliment. Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Saul Goodman, Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut (the kid named finger), and many more of the characters in Breaking Bad are some of the greatest characters of all time, in movies and television, as a matter of fact, the greatest written characters in the history of stories, in human history, which is an incredible feat.Breaking Bad is amazingly engaging and is one of the few shows that makes you feel like you are the characters. When it ends, you will want to re-watch it for the rest of your life. Breaking Bad is a show so good that it is the greatest show on television, and it's spin-off show is right behind it.Breaking Bad started a seventh of a century ago and ended a decade ago, but it still remains one of the most prominent shows in human culture, if not the most prominent and prolific. It's only matched against SpongeBob SquarePants, but not even SpongeBob and Patrick can trample Heisenberg and Cap'n Cook.Breaking Bad is 99.1% pure.Breaking Bad is numero uno.Bravo Vince."
9,"As the clueless, hapless and hopeless father of four on the celebrated series MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, Bryan Cranston came into his own, as he did an amazing balancing act that juggled slapstick, pathos and insanity all at once, proving that not only did ""father NOT know best"", but more than likely never would.Now he essays the role of another father in the new series BREAKING BAD, but it's a shocking, bracingly refreshing turn that takes his 'Three Stooges' repertoire of grunts, shrieks, barks and neurotic ticks and virtually throws them out the window. Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel. Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to ""ask nicely.""Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been ""edited for time and content"" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys. I sure hope he does...thanks to his work on BREAKING BAD, he'll need it."
10,I like the bit where they make crystal meth in the back of an RV
10,"If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest."
10,"Everything at every moment could have been decided better if truth had been told! Am watching a few seasons to remember! I proped up in bed and got over surgery with this series and LOVED MIKE!!! Wanted to strangle Marie!!! Good acting when you feel like strangling them! Don't smoke. Tell the truth. THINK before you act. Love, Granny."
9,"The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock-off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, ""living realistically as a middle class in the United States"" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like ""Bad."" The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he ""never smoked."" His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea."
10,"Everything from the subtle details, to the unmatched writing and the perfect cast, to the very beautifully shot scenes. It may very well be the best Tv-show out there. The story, even with some creative liberties, is well grounded, believable and feels very real. The show, unlike others, ages like fine wine. The more you watch and the longer you sink in the better it gets. I can think of few series which grow stronger and better every season. It's not only worth sinking your teeth into, it's worth eating. Breaking Bad is a timeless piece and it will stand even long into the future, and will forever be one of the best Tv-shows to ever come out."
10,I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.Thank you for existing.
10,"5 seasons recovered in one week. I didn't think I was going to get caught up in a series of drug dealers, but it did. Because it is tough, has a lot of black humor and above all, it makes you think about the miserable world of sociopaths and psychopaths, no matter how flamboyant it may seem at one point. A real revelation for me was the actor Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman character, a very good actor from the young generation. I'm looking forward to seeing him in follow-up film, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie."
10,"After huge recommendation and buzz about the series, I started watching on 2016 August, couldn't able to stop it. I have finished two seasons in a flight travel. The best show on the internet completely eligible to do binge watch. You will be travelling along their journey of Walter White or Jesse Pinkman. The show biggest success was how it ended, you can't a find better way to put through. I really wish would have got chance to watch in their release times.,"
10,"Some years after writing for ""The X Files"", Vince Gilligan created a show. I only saw scattered episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" during its run, but I finally got around to binge-watching the first season. Bryan Cranston puts on one of the most chilling performances in TV history as a terminally ill teacher who turns to manufacturing crystallized methamphetamine to support his family. Basically, the show is about moral ambiguity and how actions have consequences. Indeed, each episode adds a new complication.When I first read about the show during its run, I saw a picture of Bryan Cranston with a beard, glasses, and a shaved head. Having known him as the dad on ""Malcolm in the Middle"", he looked unrecognizable in that photo. But he's proved himself to be a truly versatile actor in the past few years, with roles in ""Contagion"", ""Argo"", ""Godzilla"", and ""All the Way"" (as Lyndon Johnson).In the meantime, this show will offer some of the most unusual chemistry lessons. Outstanding show. It deserved every award that it won.I wonder if Vince Gilligan has ever gotten comments about ""Gilligan's Island""."
10,"Everybody has their own opinion of how many stars a show deserves, whether more stars or fewer it's seldom so many people agree. ""Breaking Bad"" is possibly the best TV drama ever made - there isn't a wrong step, bad episode or miscast character throughout the whole series run. A willing suspension of disbelief is an absolute requirement to enjoy this drama. It is probably not plausible to believe that anyone like Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught let alone the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic characters, who nearly all resonate with most viewers, make you willing to set aside any differences with plausibility (which, admittedly, the show takes huge liberties with). Like most serials it is best not to watch the show out of order! More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes. And the show is the proverbial roller coaster, taking you to the low points and peaks right along with your favorite characters, you might not want to miss a minute in this original and daring TV drama once you start watching!"
10,"""Breaking Bad"" has 5 seasons and a total of 62 episodes. It stars Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris and RJ Mitte. The series has gained a lot of popularity over the years, and let's face it, it really is a masterpiece to be praised.Directing: Sometimes even too good. Every director who worked on the series did a great job.Writing: Very brilliant. The whole story of the series is impressively written.Acting: Absolutely fantastic! Every actor brings out their best.Editing: The editing is also very commendable! It's outstanding and unique.Soundtrack: Every song is great. There are a lot of vocal songs in the series, but for example, there is also the great, catchy intro by Dave Porter (who scored several songs for the series).All in all, this is a brilliant series that is absolutely worth watching. I can only recommend it."
10,"I am not one to beat around the bush so here it goes:This show is epic in its entirety. The writing, characters, plot, cinematography, the pacing and the incredible transformation just pushes this show into a league of it's own. It takes you into a world we haven't quite ever seen before, a world where the sad and unaccomplished Walter White turns into a genius mad-man. You can see the character evolve into a selfish, power-hungry villain who you just love to hate. Vince Gilligan did an amazing job not following the lead of most tv shows out there right now. He knew how to build a story without making you feel like you are underwhelmed and when he knew it was time for this show to end (although I felt a hole in my heart for days after the finale), he didn't care about the money or the fans or the critics, he just ended it the exact moment it was supposed to end.Bryan Cranston is a power house and completely embodies first Walter White, and later Heisenberg to such amazing heights, you really cannot see anyone else acting this part. That is what, I believe, sets his character apart from most characters we see on TV. He dominates every episode and that is not the say that the rest of the cast don't put in their best efforts (they are all amazing in their own way), but he just has this energy that is undeniable and you cannot help but root for him and the crazy plans he comes up with.Epic is the only one word you can use to describe a show like this. The only show I feel sometimes touches the bar of this pure excellence, is Vikings and it still does not come close to how well thought out Breaking Bad as a whole series truly is."
10,I eagerly want to want to watch again but after some years so that i can forgot the scenes and dialogues and i want to experience this epic show once again as i did before. Honestly speaking NOTHING WILL COMPARE WITH THIS SHOW. AND THE FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE IS GOD LEVEL EXPERIENCE.
10,"I binged breaking bad, worst mistake of my life, never binge a good show! Especially not breaking bad, binge it when rewatching, same experience. You can binge something multiple times, but you can only experience the show once. Anyways, on to the review.What hasn't been said about breaking bad? It's an absolute masterpiece that pretty much everyone has watched. It starts off with an insignificant highschool chemistry teacher and ends with a ruthless drug lord (hopefully not spoiling too much here). But this is not only the story of a broken man, what many (I think many people anyway) fail to acknowledge is the team that worked on breaking bad, the progression of the writing. The first season is a pretty good crime drama about a chemistry teacher breaking bad, nothing special. However, when you get to the last season, every goddamn frame is a breathtaking painting.If you're putting off watching this: I'm not going to urge you to watch it. Take your time, but still do watch it obviously.Breaking bad is what art is meant to be, a birth and a death. It was made with passion, not an endless money grab like the sitcom. I know it's been said over and over, but death is what makes birth meaningful and beautiful. Season 1 was good, but you need to watch the finale to fully appreciate the beginning. Breaking bad is the story of a man, but do not mistake it for a tragedy. It is simply the legacy of a prideful man. We all want our stories heard, we all want to live on in others, we are all desperately human. I simply ask you to keep the story of breaking bad going, watch the show and be grateful for Vince Gillian's creativity."
10,"Breaking Bad is a magnificent,outstanding and completely original television series that is filled with fantastic character development,action and an endless amount of highly intense and un-forgetful scenes .The series starts off fairly promising,and then as it continues it just gets better,over the course of five years,it never a goes downhill,and there isn't a single bad episode in the whole series.I think people were skeptical when the series first came around about the the dad from Malcolm in the Middle starring in a drama,but Bryan Cranston delivers an exhilarating performance in this,Walter White is nothing like Hal and thus proves that Cranston's range is amazing and he truly is a great actor,the change in Walter over the course of these five seasons proves that.But Cranston shouldn't have all the credit,no actor in this show comes across as unprofessional,but the outstanding actors have to be Anna Gunn,Aaron Paul,Dean Norris,RJ Mitte,Betsy Brandt,Bob Odenkirk,Jonathan Banks,Giancarlo Esposito,Charles Baker,Matt Jones,Jesse Plemons and Krysten Ritter are all some of the series best characters and incredible actors and they all deserve so much credit for making this's series so great,and of course,Vince Gilligan,for his incredible writing and directing skills,this show would be nothing without him.My favourite characters of the entire series are without a doubt Jesse and Mike,their personality are something that really appeals to me,and their development over the course of the series is very pleasing,I loved Walter as well,but I never felt like I could relate to him,not that I would want to.All in all,Breaking Bad is a fantastic series,it never disappoints and I would recommend it to everyone.Walter White (Bryan Cranston),a highly intelligent high school professor,joins the crystal meth business using his amazing skills in science to create a high quality and addictive product,after he learns he has lung cancer and wants to make enough money for his family to use when he's gone."
10,"The outline is clear. Most people will know what it is about even those who haven't seen the show. The teacher who decides to take a step into darkness. And the consequences, he and others have to suffer because of that. Bryan Cranston is superb in his portrayal of Walter White the chemistry teacher, who after being diagnosed with cancer, decides to take matters in his own hands.Having met an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, both undergo a journey, that has its up and downs. But while Walter White has his family (and all the relationships feel realistic), there is a special bond that is hard to explain, between Mr. White and Pinkman. Trying to depict every little great aspect of the show would take too long. The show itself though does take its time, building up tension and when it gets released, it is heavy! Be it because of the action involved or the emotional impact.The first season may seem to have a very slow pace, but even so it has more than its fair share of great moments (I'll only mention the bathtub, which had me almost crying because of laughter). Season 2 picks up and there is almost no stopping after that. There are McGuffins here and there (like the eye of a teddy bear to name but one) and they all enhance the feeling that this show is real. Feels real that is. The show is obviously for mature audiences, because of its content. Which is the violence and the behavior of characters, not any nudity!"
10,"The best in the west. Come on, it's the best in the entire world. Breaking Bad isn't just a TV show; it's an extraordinary journey into the depths of human morality, ambition, and transformation. This gripping masterpiece, created by Vince Gilligan, is a testament to the power of storytelling and the art of character development. Heisenberg, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman never ever vanishes from my mind. And the dedication of Bryan Cranston Having french beard style and Shaved head most of the time and also Jesse transformation is can't described in words. If you read my review then SAY MY NAME."
10,Nothing compares. Nothing comes close.I may currently be on my 20th dose of this show and it's still as addictive and beautiful as the first time.
10,"You read it right. This show just blew me away. I wasn't even a huge TV show fan. I would peek in from time to time on popular shows for some good entertainment, but none of them hooked me. It was just something I would do when I was bored.Then came Breaking Bad. I got lucky. One night, about six years ago or so, maybe seven, I was watching a classic movie on AMC- I think it was Goodfellas or Gladiator- one of the ones they always show. The credits went to black and I was expecting another movie in the lineup. Instead, I saw a unique shot in the desert and a Winnebago barreling through with some khaki pants flying through the air, as it revealed a guy in a gasmask driving it in his underwear with another guy passed out.At first I thought it was another 90s Hollywood movie, maybe something in Vegas like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or something quirky like that, but then I realized it wasn't. I had no idea what it was- I had never seen this ""movie"" before. But I couldn't stop watching. Soon, there was a commercial and I realized it was a TV show.And let me tell you...what came next was literally the best and most well spent TV/movie viewing hours that I had in the better part of two decades. What went onto occur blew my mind at every turn. The genius and brilliance in the subtleties and acting that came forth was unbelievable.I barely left my room for three days as AMC was running a marathon on what is now widely believed to be the greatest show of all-time, but I had no idea about that then. All I knew is that I couldn't stop watching and felt like I was addicted to it....Just so intriguing, beautiful, real, amazing, and shocking.Then came late season 4 and season 5, and I was speechless. It's not that seasons 1-3 weren't great, but when late 4 and 5 arrived, I practically jumped out of my couch and lost it. I was not expecting anything like that, but it was hands down some of the greatest filmmaking I had ever seen going back to the 70s. Honestly, words just cannot describe it. All I can say is this is the greatest show of all time. Enjoy."
10,"I finished watching Breaking Bad 8 years ago and was blown away by how brilliant it was. Original story, great character building, comedy, drama... edge of your seat moments...this show has it all.After all these years I've started rewatching on Netflix and I'm every bit as obsessed with it now as I was back then.It is absolutely unrivalled television."
10,"Albuquerque, New Mexico. A chemistry teacher, Walter White, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. By chance he runs into a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman, who is now a crystal meth dealer. This gives him an idea on how to pay for his medical bills and provide for his family upon his death...Fantastic series. Starts innocently enough and builds tension and momentum with every episode. So many dangers and hurdles in his path - from small time hoodlums to drug lords, his wife, plus Walter's own brother is a DEA agent!In addition, while their enterprise is a very illegal one and one with some unique challenges, Walt and Jesse's struggles are relatable. Most of the issues they face, especially initially, are what all small businesses face - finding a location, distribution, capital, supply, competitors, regulation, restless (in this case, homicidal!) partners/shareholders - and the series demonstrates this quite superbly.The Walter White character arc is also quite something to behold.It's not just about the plot though, everything about this show is fantastic. Direction is incredibly innovative, especially for a TV series. Clever use of camera angles and shot depth. It's the sort of stuff you only usually see in movies and then Orson Welles-directed ones at that.Wonderful cinematography and scenery: great use of colour and the vast, unspoilt New Mexico landscapes.Casting and performances are spot-on: nobody puts a foot wrong.Absolutely brilliant."
10,"Time is so fast! But it's only five seasons in six years, and then it's over, like saying goodbye to the person you care about the most."
10,"Not quite on this website, but at least on others, this is ranked as the greatest TV show of all time and it's pretty easy to see why. Everyone should be familiar with the story already. It's about this guy named Walter and his assistant Jesse who sell meth initially to raise money for Walt's family as he hears he's dying but eventually himself becomes selfish and destructive. Right from the get go, we get a fantastic set up and iconic images and characters. Probably the main reason this show was so wonderful was simply because it didn't try to be anything more than it wanted to be.It just wanted to be a realistic representation of the increasing insanity of an ordinary person and the huge web of destruction he got himself entangled in. There are so many unique and profound characters in this show that it's hard to name them all. Okay, I can still remember the two main ones I just mentioned. Maybe the main appeal was that this show didn't go on too long. It had a very defined story that it wanted to tell and it wasted no time in telling it right away. It just seems like not a single episode of this show was wasted.What's amazing is how smart these characters are, especially Walter. From the very first episode, we see how observant he is noticing all the little details in everything and how they can help or hurt him. The story continually builds on itself until the massive explosion in the last episodes, giving the viewers exactly what they want. It may be the most dramatic show I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything is so intense and realistic. It's great that a completely ordinary show manages to be so effective and influential. ****"
9,"What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while."
10,"I have never seen a show that I loved so much from the start until the very end. It never went down in quality, actually I feel it become even better in later seasons. And while not everything that was happening was what I liked, I still thought that it was done brilliantly. I am just sad it is over, I could go on watching it longer.Created by Vince Gilligan, the show goes about a chemistry teacher Walter White who gets cancer and tries to make money for his family by getting together with his old student Jesse Pinkman and cook meth. The relationship between the two is one of my favorite parts of the show. They have such a great dynamics, so much chemistry (no pun intended) and seeing their friendship develop going through bumps etc. was beautiful.All acting on the show is A class. Just as characters. So many different people very complex and greatly performed by the actors. This doesn't just go to the characters I loved, but even the ones who I didn't like, such as Walt's whole family. Their performances made the shows as great as it is just like the plot did.And I must say, I found out some spoilers ahead of time. But watching the moments was still very intense and sort of unexpected. This shows how well it is done. The show is not only unpredictable because of ""what happens"" but also because of ""how"". Watch it! This is the best show of our time,impossible to not enjoy it and it will be a classic. I will try to follow the work of the creator and the actors from now on."
10,"What hasn't already been said about Breaking Bad?It's brilliant.4,500+ reviewers here on IMDB have probably said all that needs saying - but I've just watched it all through again and I'm gonna add my bit.We don't know the drug producing criminal underworld. We don't know the anger of a frustrated genius. We (in the main) don't know how we would think if we had cancer and not much time to provide for our family. Breaking Bad starts with these things and boy - does it get bad...!Everything about this works. There is a bit of Jesse in all of us, a bit of Walt in all of us, Skyler, Marie, Hank - they are all a lot like us. But some have different capabilities than others.... The characters and acting is excellent, the camera work in New Mexico superb. The story, drama and the build-ups are relentless.It's the descent, the ego, the destruction of - pretty much everything. Then there is the fragility, the feeling of ""in-too-deep""; so many feelings are brought to the surface here - all in a completely extreme but somehow believable way. Breaking Bad is extraordinary."
10,"Having just watched the finale of Breaking Bad, I can now say that it is one of the few series that work perfectly from beginning to end. This isn't to say it couldn't be criticized - it was often far fetched, and in the first season the series didn't quite have a hold of its characters, with Walter making some overly-sudden shifts and Jesse's IQ seemingly wandering up and down - but it was always incredibly intelligent and entertaining, the acting was always amazing, and the show managed to effortlessly move from gritty realism to flights of fancy (like that mariachi song that began one episode).It is wondrous how beautifully formed character arcs are. Walter, who loses tiny pieces of his soul in ever episode, Jesse, who lets himself be lead into deeper and deeper waters, and Skyler, whose underrated (and often castigated) role is perhaps most relatable; she has to choose between the rock and the hard place, and knows from the start that there are no good options. What's most impressive about Breaking Bad is it never fell apart. There were no extraneous episodes, no period where it lost momentum or seemed to be treading water. The show moved with purpose. It knew what it was about - consequences and arrogance - and it never lost sight of that. It was a series that remained true to itself. Some series start great and lose their way (Lost), some series fall apart in the end (Battlestar Gallactica), some get taken over by people with a different vision (Gilmore Girls), some brilliant series get canceled in the first season, so no matter how good that ending was going to be, we'll never see it (Earth II). Breaking Bad gave us five virtually perfect years, and the only thing bad about it is now that it's over I need to find something new to binge watch."
10,"I've been around a long time and I've seen a lot of television, but I've never been hooked on a series like this one nor have I seen so many others hooked at the same time. This epic and excellent series performed the remarkable act of getting better each and every season with two of its greatest episodes near the end and the finale. The performances are all superb, but let's face it. It's the writing that makes this so amazing. I didn't start writing reviews on here again until this year (a few prior years worth were erased by someone) and I never review things unless I watch them again, but I'm not sure I will ever watch all of this again as there is so much television these days, but I might, so this is an opinion from the past and I doubt a second viewing would alter my view. This is magnificent."
10,"I have never watched any series which depicts emotions so exactly through camera angles, dialogues, screen play, perfect story line other than ""Breaking Bad"". We all are lucky enough to be born to watch series like this. Teaches us loyalty, family love, pain and many more things.More than anything this series teaches people to live life the different way and changes people mindset towarss life.There are scenes which will stay with you forever after this series and it will change the way you watch TV Series and life for that matter.I don't think I will ever see any series which will be better than this.Perfection!"
10,"What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very few series that competes with the best films in history for cinematic storytelling. Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing. A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles, this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and more disturbing each year. In a way, thematically it recalls ""The Godfather I and II"" in how that epic charts Michael's journey from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the American drive for money and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a game we can never win.Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff."
10,"It is not enough to even make long reviews about this series.After watching this series, I entered the world of TV series for good.An excellent series in every way.It has already become a classic."
9,Season 1 : 8.8/10Season 2 : 8.8/10Season 3 : 9.5/10Season 4 : 9.8/10Season 5 : 10/10
8,"A great series, especially the first, fourth and fifth parts .. There is some boredom in it, but it is worthy that one is following it carefully."
10,"I finally got around to watching breaking bad in 2022, more than 10 years after the show first premiered. This is at the top of the list for best rated shows and it's a series that has been recommended to me a lot of times and... wow. What an absolutely outstanding piece of television.It's perfectly paced across 5 seasons, bringing gripping portrayals of what feels like real people. The events are shocking, real, clever and all around well written and though out. The show brings out so many different emotions, and will take you on a rollercoaster ride through twist and turns. Ultimately culminating in a near perfect ending, that will leave the audience satisfied, but with a sense of dread as the credits roll one final time. The cinematography is absolutely outstanding, capturing and you see a lot of the same techniques being used in movies and others show to this day.Breaking bad changed the industry while bringing some of the best portrayed and written characters ever put to screen. Now I wish I could erase all memory of the show, so I could watch it for the first time once more.10/10."
10,"THIS SHOW IS IN MY TOP 5 OF THE BEST SERIES I'VE EVER WATCHED IN MY WHOLE LIFE!IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A SERIES TO BE AS GOOD, WELL COVERED AND WELL ACTED AS THIS ONE??? THIS IS IMPECCABLE.ALL PRAISE FOR THIS SHOW IS LITTLE."
10,Just finished watching for the second time and i cant believe how brilliant and perfect this series isIts really hard to express the brilliance there has never been anything better then breaking bad hands down to the GOAT
10,"This is perhaps the single greatest series ever made. Problem is, everything else pales into insignificance before it; nothing will ever compare to it. It has singlehandedly ruined my past, present and future series experiences."
10,"I watched this as it aired so I've not seen the earlier seasons for many years now. After Saul I thought I'd re-watch it, see if I still think it's great and settle the debate about which show is better.Yes it's an easy call to make. BB is sooooo much better than Saul it's not even a debate. Saul is very very good. And it has some amazing moments and great episodes and I'd say the character arcs in Saul might even be better/more rewarding than those in BB.However, BB is just one of the best shows ever, it's like crack you just keep watching and the story, acting, cinematography, colours, pacing - it's all just spot on!!It is the best show ever made in my view but it's fair to say I haven't seen everything, so I'll say it's the best show I've ever seen!If for any reason you haven't seen it, do."
10,"Binge-watching addiction, awe, esteem mixed with sulfurous hot pepper are some of the feelings and definitions that are experienced and come to mind when thinking and talking about Breaking Bad.The one and only series where in every episode my jaw dropped for one minute throughout it.The one and only series where the unfolding of the story and the episodes were flawless.The one and only series where Meth was a beautiful, attractive and pure hypnotizing blue substance.The one and only series where the name of Heisenberg was a Brand, driving you mad and forever anchored itself in your mind.The one and only series where you wished you had your memory erased, to watch it again and again till end of your life.And the one and only series where standard and quality were redefined all over again.It was a true and personal honor to know and watch this show.Kudos and special congratulations to every one of the persons involved, especially and foremost to Bryan Cranston. You will be forever missed.Heisenberg, YOU MADE HISTORY."
10,"Many years ago, a friend of mine told me to watch this new series called Breaking Bad. The way he raved about it I thought I'd give it a go just to shut him up. I really couldn't get in to it and, after the pilot episode, gave up and didn't watch it any more.Fast forward to 2019.Looking through Netflix I came across this series once again so thought I'd give it another go.Now, I don't know if I've changed in these past years or I just didn't give it long enough first time round but, Wow! Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it. From Jesse's awkward moment having dinner with Walt and Sky, to Walt's maniacal laughter whilst under the floorboards of his house.So to my friend I owe an apology. I should have listened to you and watched this great show a long time ago."
10,"Rewatching for the 4th time, still love everything about it! It's among the best crime series, dramas, and the top notch drug story. Very deserving of the 2 Emmy wins and some of highest rated episodes. Everything plays out so well with exceptional dialogue and music."
10,"Breaking Bad is a perfect series. This is a fact. In the past, there were movies and series. They lived in a very different universe from each other. Nowadays there are cinematographic television series. In the 70s, 80s and 90s, series such as Full House, Seinfield and Family Ties with the formula of Sitcom and Miami Vice, 21 Jump Street and Starsky and Hutch with the formula of detective fiction appeared. In 1992, Twin Peaks appeared, a series with episodes of almost an hour long, with a cinematic style, including having been created by a film director, David Lynch. Other series emerged with a cinematic style, such as The Wire, Oz, Mad Men and The Sopranos. Breaking Bad is the most cinematic of them all. Walter White is the most complex and best-developed character in the history of world television. There are dozens and dozens of memorable and memorable scenes in Breaking Bad. The series holds up great over five seasons, which is no easy feat. It's also impressive how the series managed to build a sensational episode in which more than 30 minutes of episode take place inside a laboratory. The episode ""The Fly"", serves to develop the relationship between Walt and Jessie. The figure of Walt\Heisenberg is a very emblematic figure. He is the personification of the anti-hero. The series remains one of the best series of all time or perhaps the best."
10,"This is one of those top of the league series. Once you start watching you can't stop it. My wife and I were completely hooked on this series. Brilliant actors with a great storyline. A lot of twists that makes it that you want to see the next episode as soon as possible. The suspense that is build in every episode is great. You can't do anything else then hope that Walter White gets away with it. Too bad that at one point the series had to stop because for us it could have gone on and on forever. So we were disappointed when it was over but now that there is a spin off we are already looking forward to that one. If ""Better Call Saul"" is in the same way then it can't go wrong. Anyways, ""Breaking Bad"" is a must-see if you never saw it."
10,"I have no words to describe how amazing and amazing this series is. It's really good, it doesn't have a boring chapter and the drama is amazing. Great performances, well-done scripts, amazing direction and well-done characters. The writer of this series is a genius!!"
10,"Greetings from Lithuania.What can i say about this show that hasn't been said before. Not much, but here it is. If you haven't seen it yet, do your self a favor and watch, because it's a magnificent series from start to finish. Probably the best accomplished show ever. Not overlong, 5 seasons, in a terrific shape start till end. Everything in this show clicks on highest cylinders, and i mean everything. Acting, writing, directing are brilliant, and what a cinematography - thanks to it you won't feel you are watching a TV show, it's a world itself. Unforgettable characters, villains, deaths, twists (not overwritten!) - it hardly gets better than this. Yes, it has one (just one) weak episode (Fly), of course not by the guilt of creators but just producers and yet they managed to create something out of nothing. Overall, if you like watching / don't like watching TV shows in general, ""Breaking Bad"" is an almost universal entrainment which you will never forget."
10,Addictive. Each cast member at his/her best. Creative in every way including the Score and the soundtrack.
10,"This is by far the greatest TV show ever.I was expecting the typical path every show takes with the same old predictable directions they go in, but luckily I didn't read online and knew nothing of the spoilers. As a result, I was taken in and blown away.The casting alone is brilliant. Every single character was casted perfectly, and I mean perfectly. That alone is genius and falls along the lines of Pulp Fiction with the way Travolta, Thurman, and Samuel L Jackson were casted, along with Harvey Keitel.But then you get absorbed into this world you never thought you would meet, nor have you ever seen before. You keep waiting for it to become a typical show and for it to ""jump the shark"", but as the seasons progress, you just never witness or experience that at all.Instead, the show actually takes you to a place that you never saw coming (if you didn't know spoilers), and it is actually a place of truth. This experience defies twenty or more years of cinema, including the movies.No matter what anyone says, I don't care, this is possibly the greatest cinematic experience I have witnessed as a whole since the mid-90's. You cannot even compare it to other TV shows, really, because it is not a TV show as much as it is a 60 hour movie that never circles or tangents itself like every other ""TV show"".The acting is incredible. Every single actor or actress nailed their role. The subtexts, themes, and profundity is all in there, but not everyone will find those things. A masterpiece?.....Is there a term for something beyond a masterpiece? If there was, then this is it.20/10"
10,"I have to echo another reviewer on here and say that as of the past many years I have not watched television, save PBS, Discovery, or History channel. And the news, of course. There has been nothing except The Sopranos and Family Guy in the realm of series that warranted my attention. Almost everything out there is stupid drivel that insults the intelligence of educated human beings. But Now !! Now we have Breaking Bad !!!All I can say is: HOLY S**T !!! This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters. This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over. Yeah, this is a TV series !!! On AMC !! Hard to believe. This is one I'm raving about to everyone I know, and hope keeps going for a long, long time !!! Thanks to everyone involved with this genius show !!!"
10,"A very worthy contender for the greatest TV show of all time. Has there ever been a story so unique, so compelling and so well-developed? Not only do we have breathtaking drama, there is also a touch of dark humour that gives the show an extra dimension. Breaking Bad is completely devoid of cheesiness and predictability but never falls prey to pretentious artsiness.And then there is the acting. Bryan Cranston's performance is staggering and the character development of Walter White is possibly unmatched in television history. Aaron Paul, Dean Norris and Giancarlo Esposito are also just ridiculously good.I truly feel sorry for every other televison show as they are pretty much all left in the dust by this masterpiece."
7,"This is a hard show to review. The first few seasons were incredible but I feel that they dragged it out too long. As the weeks go by I found myself thinking ""really, there are 5 seasons of this"". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end.I know people will think I am mad for writing this but does a show that is fantastic but sucks the soul and heart out of you make for as good TV as everyone believes; or was everyone else too caught up in the hype to admit their true feelings about Breaking Bad."
10,"Breaking Bad is definitely in the top 5 of my all time best TV series . I have just finished watching it for a second time and enjoyed it just as much or more than my first viewing. Can't understand the bad reviews that this show is getting but ""To each his own """
10,"To say this program has great writing is an understatement. BB has the best writing I have ever had the pleasure of listing & reading (I always leave the captioning on). The acting is top notch by Cranston. It is also very good by Aaron Paul (Pinkman), Dean Norris (Hank), Betsy Brandt (Marie), RJ Mitte (Walt junior). Unfortunately, it feels like Anna Gunn (Skyler) is the weak link. It is hard to know if the Gilligan is trying to make a somewhat awkward and unlikable character, or if it is just not hitting the mark. I prefer to think that the writing is intentionally odd for Skyler for some reason, and that we will get to learn more in the episodes and seasons to come. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant for the most part – it almost always rings true. The episodes are gripping (for the most part). The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. I have to opt for a 10/10 because there is not another program that comes close – even Dexter which I've been enjoying for 5 seasons doesn't have the writing or acting to stand up to BB."
9,"Bryan Cranston shows his acting skills portraying the complex character of Walter White. He's a long suffering high school chemistry teacher who suddenly finds he's dying of cancer. With little prospect of leaving anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make meth. They're so good at it that they become major criminals.This is the best of television which can be found on cable. Walter White is a complex character that actually grows over the life of the show. He is a good character that we root for at the beginning even thought he's become a criminal. The journey he makes is one worthy of great literature. It is absolutely must see TV."
10,Best ever series. There is never a dull moment and always something new and out of the box. I have already watched it a couple of times. Top rated actors and story.
10,"The best TV show ever streamed, there are shows and there is Breaking Bad, how it builds from the begining and getting intense all along til the finale, the characters writing and acting, no effects or fiction needed just reality that surpass all, it's a journey that will break your heart just for finishing."
7,"Ok, so while it isn't quite the holy grail it's made out to be, 'Breaking Bad' is a solid series. I give it a concrete 7. It is well worth watching. It absolutely IS a good series. Just allow for a steady stream of implausible moments throughout the series where various story points just aren't remotely believable.Enjoy the good (there is plenty), and look over the ludicrous (there is plenty). Enjoy the show."
7,"I watched the first three seasons of Breaking Bad.I liked the series, although it is much more flawed than I expected.What I liked:What I disliked: - too many lengthy parts - often we're caught in really boring everyday drudgery that the producers apparently didn't have the heart to cut out - too many incongruent parts over time - the character development is weak and made me want to switch off after a while. I kept watching purely for the quality of the actors (who make up for it somewhat) - way too many clichés - too much repetition - some characters become irritating after a while, because they lack real growth (e.g. Skyler)"
9,This first season are very slow but intersting at every season there will be thrillng at the end it will say''Die with memories'' not ''with dreams''
10,"What is called good?It's something that stands out from other kinds of things.What kind of thing is called wonderful?It was something completely beyond anything contemporary.What is impeccable? It is not only beyond ""wonderful"", but also wistful. It has a meaning and emotion that you don't have to think about.So, this show is impeccable."
10,"Season1: not bad~Worth 8.8Season2: uh, just so so...Worth8.9Season3: unbelievable. Worth 9.2Season4: brilliant. Worth 9.6Season5: Jesus, Christ! Worth 10.0."
9,"Yes, as many others have written before me, Breaking Bad is without a doubt one of the best series of all time.The story of how a desperate chemistry teacher ventures into the drug business with a former student of him is brilliant.Walter White and Jesse Pinkman face many ups and downs during their attempt of overtaking the Crystal-Meth-Market.In addition, the characters with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are also perfectly cast. But the other actors play their parts very good aswell.A clear recommendation on my part.The series just doesn't get a 10/10 from me because I wouldn't call it one of my favorite shows."
10,I finished Breaking Bad around 4ish months ago and i have tossed and turned on a 9/10 or 10/10. Well after being a 9/10 for a while i have now reranked it for what i believe to be the last time.Breaking Bad is a 10/10 and my personal favourite show of all-time.
10,This show was easily a cinematic masterpiece its the best show I watched. From the cinematography to the songs used it's the best. It starts slow but if you give it a chance it speeds up and gets more action-packed. Almost every episode is good. One episode 3x10 is pretty slow but almost every episode is great and it is easily one of the best shows of all time beside better call Saul. I highly suggest watching this show and the rest of the breaking bad universe. I recommend watching the breaking bad universe in this order: 1. Breaking Bad 2. El Camino (Movie) 3. Better call Saul This order is the best for the storyline of the breaking bad universe and if you watch this show you will easily love it. Everything about the show is perfect all the actors are less well known and Aaron Paul had no prior acting experience but still played one of the important characters of the show and he even hung out with drug addicts to have real experience and to act his role perfectly.
9,"Breaking Bad is a show I avoided for a while due to the fact I thought it looked overhyped from a distance and I had the show spoiled for me already. If you are in the same boat as those two previous things, watch the show right now. It is even better than what people say it is. Despite knowing how the show ends, almost every second of this show still kept me captivated and interested. I fell in love with the way the characters are studied and presented. My only issues with this show have to be that the two brothers have some really corny scenes, and there are some parts that don't make any type of sense. However, the amazing cinematography and the emotions that the show got out of me in the last 3 episodes really made up for those flaws that I had to rate it so highly."
10,"Generally, I only watch Sci-Fi, Horror and such-- but every once in a while I'm drawn to regular TV if it isn't run-of-the-mill Canned-Ha-Ha-Ha comedy or standardized Network Primetime Drama with the usual A-Z cast of Beautiful People pretending to mimic Real Life interspersed with Fun Commercials as the rest of us would Like it to be.The storyline is simple: Ordinary Middle-class Teacher in an Ordinary Burb with ordinary Financial problems with an Ordinary Sucky Life finds out he has Cancer. Which makes every ordinary thing suck even worse. So he turned his Ordinary chemistry skills to Illegality so he can make some money--quick. And we get to watch the whole set of terrible, unfolding, yet still very ORDINARY set of events. And you just KNOW, it's not going down a very good road at all, but like a car with no brakes heading down a long mountain road, you have no choice but to clutch the wheel and hang on for dear life.I've heard and read of this show described as black comedy. I wouldn't put it quite like that. Black Humor is the best phrase I can come up with-- but the humor is a brilliant side-effect of the story. It's somewhere in the middle-- as in between Black and Grey. . .like Charcoal: the type that comes off on your fingers.I don't laugh or even chuckle; I wince. I cringe. I say: ""Oh my god! No, No!"" If this is comedy-- it's the comedy that Hurts and cuts. It's the laughter that comes out of an adult mouth that doesn't have a smile on it: and oh yes, he's laughing as only an Adult can.The people in this show hold me because it isn't the parade of Beautiful People and Perfect Families that Hollywood and the Networks keeps trying to brainwash us with. Painfully ordinary. The houses, the school, the people, the motives, the lighting, the camera-work. And I am watching Working Man Walter White grasp for something lasting to keep hold of. . .and I am ROOTING for him!This show is Different. It's Drama about Quiet Desperation with an edge of Black Humor that will touch a lot of Uncomfortable places that we are not used to seeing on our friendly Network Screens. Yet when you see it, you are shocked that the creators have DARED to film it and make it look so. . .plausible and painful. Bravo!!"
10,"The series centers around Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturing drug dealer. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of White is nothing short of phenomenal, capturing the transformation of a desperate man into a ruthless criminal. Aaron Paul, playing his former student and business partner Jesse Pinkman, delivers a powerful performance, embodying a character filled with conflict and vulnerability.What sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart is its intricate storytelling and character development. The series is a slow burn, meticulously building tension and complexity with each episode. It explores themes of morality, consequence, and the human capacity for change, often blurring the lines between right and wrong.The cinematography and visual storytelling are also standout features. The show uses color, camera angles, and symbolism to enhance the narrative, creating a visually captivating experience.The supporting cast, including characters like Hank Schrader, Skyler White, and Gus Fring, add depth and intrigue to the story. Each character is well-developed, with their own arcs and motivations that intertwine with the main plot.While the show is intense and sometimes brutally violent, it's balanced with moments of dark humor and irony. This combination keeps the audience engaged and emotionally invested in the characters' journeys.Overall, ""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece of modern television. Its compelling narrative, exceptional acting, and artistic direction make it a must-watch series that has set a high bar for TV dramas. It's a thought-provoking exploration of human nature and the consequences of our choices, leaving a lasting impact on its audience."
10,"Breaking Bad is just one of those shows that is intelligently written with brilliant acting. Everything about it is top notch. Bryan Cranston who is well known to TV audiences for his role in Malcolm in the Middle is cast against type as anti-hero Walter White. Aaron Paul nails it perfectly as small time criminal Jesse Pinkman.Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is an overqualified high school chemistry teacher who is struggling to make ends meet with his loving wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and his son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) who has to live with cerebral palsy. When Walter is diagnosed with Stage 3A inoperable lung cancer, Walter must find a way to ensure his family is financially secure after he passes away. Walt embarks on a career of drugs and crime by forming an uneasy alliance with Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), one of Walter's former students turned small time criminal. Together with Walt's brilliant scientific knowledge and Jesse's street smarts they both start manufacturing and selling a unique ""blue sky"" methamphetamine which proves to be a success in the drug market. Walt must also keep this hidden not only from his family but his brother in law DEA Agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) and his wife Marie (Betsy Brandt) who is also Skyler's sister. Under the pseudonym ""Heisenberg"" Walter transforms from a moral, mild mannered citizen to a ruthless, intimidating criminal.Bryan Cranston was a true deserved recipient of every accolade and award for his role as Walter White. He was fantastic and without a doubt this will be a very memorable moment for the rest of his career.Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman was a breakout role for him. Previously known for bit parts in an assortment of movies, Breaking Bad certainly put Aaron Paul on the map. Here he shines alongside Bryan Cranston.Creator Vince Gilligan who cut his teeth on The X Files has produced a brilliantly intelligent TV series that has never had one dull moment. There's plenty of dark humour, shock moments, mature themes that explore the ugly side of the drug lifestyle, and non-stop moments that will make you smile. The show still retains a lot of realism and believability and nothing is over exaggerated nor over the top in order to entertain and attract viewers. The cinematography was also brilliant and captures not only Walter White and Jesse Pinkman's interactions, but also the supporting characters that hold up the show. Breaking Bad was also well known for being (in)famous for putting Albuquerque, New Mexico well and truly on the map. Albuquerque is also well known for attracting a large number of loyal fans of Breaking Bad with fans spotting Walter's house and Jesse's house as well as certain spots where Breaking Bad was filmed.Breaking Bad is definitely one of the finest shows of all time and well and truly deserved every single acclaim. Even though the show ran from 2008-2013, there are still many fans of the show that still sing its praises. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul will also be remembered for their best roles of their respective careers.Breaking Bad is still a pleasure to revisit, and those that have not seen the series yet are missing out on top notch television at its finest.A well deserved 10/10."
10,"This series is so much more than just television. It's a masterpiece! It's a look into humanity when desperation is the driving force. Regular people turning into who they're meant to be. Honestly it's a show I've watched many times through. The last 8 episodes of season 5 I have watched too many times to count. We're not here to talk about that. This is about some of the most stellar writing EVER. The situations in each episode are just so well done. The way they get out of the situations is nothing short of spectacular! They thought of everything...from watching wardrobes change with attitudes to lighting to camera shots to music. Right down to the last second of the series. So thoughtfully and wonderfully made I swear. And the drama, I mean damn, you'll be on the edge of your seat many times. They ended this series at the perfect time. Although I could've watched it for many more years. Because they didn't wait for it to get stale and stagnant you never have time to get bored. I read years ago that Jessie(Aaron Paul) wasn't supposed to live past a few episodes but the chemistry between him and Walter(Bryan Cranston) was so great they ended up keeping him. Wether this is true or not, I couldn't imagine it any other way! It's just perfection. I will say season 2 is when they flesh the characters out and it's the slowest season but it's still amazing. If you haven't seen this one, it's time! You will not be sorry."
10,"Breaking Bad is one of the ahem.. the best tv series to exist in its genre. It is absolutely flawless, amazing character development, flawless acting."
10,"I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week! 10/10 Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show!"
6,"Pros: well cast, great acting and mostly highly entertaining. Lots of interesting characters, fun moments and once in a while: great action.Cons: To keep the drama rolling, the writers want us to accept characters that act like morons on a regular basis, and perpetually make decisions that make little to no sense on any level. It's not only infuriating but very quickly gets tedious. The two main characters seem to be hellbent on sabotaging themselves for no other reason than moving the story forward.It's annoying, mostly because it should be unnecessary if you have competent writers.Entertaining escapism for sure. Deserving a 9.5+ score? Sorry, no."
10,"Breaking Bad is one of the best, most memorable and quirkiest shows to air in this day and age. Bryan Cranston plays Walter White, a stressed-out and tetchy school teacher and father of a cerebral-palsy-diagnosed son, who's struggling to keep his family's life secure. On top of that, his wife Skyler White is expecting a baby. His life gets all the more chaotic when he discovers that he has lung cancer, and he won't take sh!t from anyone anymore. Walter teams up with a former pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman, to cook crystal meth and secure his family's future. Walter breaks bad, and he never goes back.Breaking Bad is the most amazing kind of television show being made; overarching stories and character subtexts that are IMPORTANT in the grand scheme of the series, characters and all. Breaking Bad is hilarious, shocking, and lovingly original take on drug-culture and the thugs living in and around it. The characters are amazing; not just Walter, but Hank Schrader and Saul Goodman are standout characters in themselves, one being a morally-complicated police officer and the other a sleazy but street-smart lawyer. And let's not even get started with Mike Ehrmantraut: the 'clean-up' man of the show who's got his eye on you... and 'Gus'.Vince Gilligan has cooked the perfect substance: a show so pure and full of powerful beats that many television shows envy it for its genius arcs and subtle character motivations slowly paying off over the course of the show. I'd personally want to shake hands with him and thank him for giving the world such an entertaining and smart show littered with great characters.Breaking Bad has broken so many barriers in the world of television that all the major networks hoping to emulate the success of this crystal meth gem; and they owe it to Vince Gilligan's black-comedy crime-drama magnum opus.Watch this show. For television lovers you owe yourself this series, if you haven't seen it already!"
10,"The show follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who turns to a life of crime, producing and selling crystal meth, after he is diagnosed with cancer. My favourite aspect of the show is its extremely tight writing, but its complex characters and exceptional performances, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter White are a close second.I've rated Breaking Bad a 10 out of 10 as it is an absolute marvel of television storytelling that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The show's combination of humor, drama, and suspense is masterful, and its character development is unparalleled by any show I've ever seen. The show's themes of power, morality, and redemption are explored in such intensive depth, that it makes Breaking Bad not only a thrilling ride, but a thought-provoking meditation on the human condition. If you're a fan of television drama or even television series in general, Breaking Bad is a must-watch series that I believe would leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it."
10,"Breaking bad was the second best show of all time, only behind game of thrones. However, the GOT final season was so bad that breaking bad is now on top. I'm rewatching it for the 4th time and honestly love it more and more each time. Never again will you see character development and brilliant writing like this show"
10,"This show is like an amalgamation of the greatest crime movies ever made, without ever feeling or coming across like it's copying from them and separating itself as its own unique thing with a completely original premise. It's like the story of Walter White glides through an anthology of classic crime movies without any lines drawn between which and where they begin or end.Whether you are a fan of Pulp Fiction, Scarface, The Usual Suspects, Departed, Goodfellas, American Beauty, Heat, even the Terminator and a touch of the Shining, or an ironic list of other famous films of different genres, you will find similar bits, pieces, semblances, as well as homages to them from time to time throughout. But don't expect any one of those films as a whole because this is a totally unique piece of art in itself.The most entertaining aspect of the show for me was the Business part about it- the way the money is handled and the businesses are created, conducted, and operating are startlingly and impressively realistic in every way into every last detail. The drama, family, relationships, morality, crime genre, dark humor, and character development are all excellent or magnificent, but the realistic way the show handles the business aspect of the show was so impressive and really blew me away. The amount of detail that went into the story construction reveals that the creators did their homework, research, hired experts, and have had their own life experience with entrepreneurship and the business world.It is also important to the story because it is the main catalyst in the protagonists' profound motivations, which makes so much sense. This also branches off into money laundering and lots of big business meetings and dealings. The hierarchy of who is the boss, who is the helper, employee, partner, investor, associate, competitor, and new hire is perfectly arranged and realistic.In addition, the protagonist must deal with the growing pains of the business world. Like many entrepreneurs, he succeeds and fails, starts over at times, restructures, learns the ropes, exploits advantages with his product in certain markets, and tries to reach a potential, or at least his goal.The business aspect is more of an impersonal construct of the show, but it is the character development of not just the protagonist, but several main characters, that are incredibly conceived that is the best person part about the show. When you first meet many of the characters, they seem insignificant, or like they are going to be conventional side characters that only appear on the peripherals from time to time, but you can be surprised who these people really are or how significant they might be.There are huge surprises, twists, turns, and mindblowing moments along the way, but don't expect them constantly. The show really takes its time in developing the characters, plot, and story- fleshing out its own world in the sunny Albuquerque suburbs and desert area- before it seldom pulls the trigger.The first season and a half delve heavily into the protagonist's battle with cancer and the affect it has on him and his family, but they also introduce plenty of drama, suspense, action, and surprises. Dark humor is one of the predominant features of this part of the show. If you don't enjoy dark humor, you may find it slow at times, but if you stick with it, you will definitely be rewarded in the later seasons. If you do enjoy the humor, then this will probably become your favorite show.From late season 2 to the end of season 3, the show begins to turn slightly darker and become far more dramatic. There is family drama, drug drama, and crime drama. Season 4 is stunning and will blow the viewer away with brilliant writing, plot development, plenty of surprises, and nonstop suspense. It is loaded with classic scenes and episodes.Season 5 is my personal favorite, as there is unbelievably no fat at all in any episode, for the most part, and this is the final season where all loose ends and everything revealed in seasons 1-4 all come back into play and receive closure, which elevates the entire meaning of everything that came before it.Breaking Bad is wickedly popular among fans, critics, and many top professionals in Hollywood, or the film industry in general. It has influenced, inspired, impacted so many writers, directors, actors, producers, and cinematographers. There are several popular shows and movies that have come out since it aired where you can pick up on direct borrowing and sort of imitating many things that Breaking Bad did on all different levels from story/plot, writing, character development, editing, and overall concept. Some people who have seen shows or films Breaking Bad influenced prior to watching it may not be as affected by some of its brilliance since they are working backward on the timeline.The acting in it is truly amazing. It probably is the best acted TV series of all time without a doubt. Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best acting performances ever, but the supporting cast is almost just as good. Usually, there is a dropoff in tv shows in movies; you'll have one or two great performances, but the rest of the smaller supporting cast is basic and average, but in Breaking Bad, there are truly excellent performances and the roster runs deep. This is the kind of show or movie where even the smallest roles are memorable. There really isn't one bad actor in any part of the series, and that's part of what makes it so good.Last, I'll mention the dialogue, quotes, and lines. I was not expecting this at all, but this show is loaded with famous lines and dialogue. It all ties back into the script writing, which is brilliant. So many scenes will blow you away with the witty, realistic dialogue and quotes. This is the hallmark of a classic work of film art. It just exceeds expectations for a TV series.Once you are finished watching this masterpiece, watch it again because there is so much attention to detail that you can't pick up on in your first watch. There are all kinds of foreshadowing, symbolism, references, and little details that will make you appreciate it even more. This is not a show where one watch is enough. It gets better every time you watch it. Also, be sure to learn about the making of it, behind the scenes, the story of how it got made, all the Emmy awards and other awards it won, the records it set, what other prestigious names in Hollywood like Anthony Hopkins said about it, and all of the greatly written articles on it. It will really help you cope with it ending. But a warning: it is so addictive and good that you will probably find it difficult to let go, and every other show in the future will pale in comparison.If you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, do yourself a favor and experience this once in a lifetime classic. Avoid any spoilers, and it will be ten times as good like it was for me and first time viewers during its airing."
10,"Spoiler free review of this and i am utterly shocked by how good this show was. Season 1 started off slow so dont drop the show so quickly, this show becomes one of the greatest shows of all time and my favourite show.It really dives deep into Walter Whites character and his development throughout the show. He starts off as a boring high school Chemistry Teacher with cancer to a Drug Lord Millionaire. Another great part about this show is its Cinematography the shots and camera angles placed by Vince Gilligan are gorgeous and beautiful. And dont get me started on the acting, the acting for this show is absolutely amazing and gut wrenching. To Parents: DO NOT WORRY, This show isn't bad for children who are 13+ however, make sure that your child is VERY mature going into this show. Most of the sexuality is in season 1 and is almost completely gone by season 3-5 in fact, Season 5 has no sexuality, The Gore however is quite frequent and sometimes graphic Mostly in season 1 and 4 with Season 4 Eps 1 being the most brutal eps in the show but you can just close your eyes if you cant watch it. Season 5 is the most saddest season and has loads of intense scenes. This show might be a little Mature for the younger audience but it tells a magnificent story and you should definitely give it a go."
10,"You know a series is a masterpiece when you end up watching it as a re-run merely 6 months after watching the original. To this day this series, has standards set so high, that I am personally unable to find anything to watch which matches its standards. I am yet to come across an actor who can play a character which is Walter White who is an embodiment of hero, anti-hero, part-comedic, part-villian. This is not a character which is purely black or white, there are numerous tones and undertones of gray in this character. And yet, Bryan Cranston has not just played such a complex character, but played it par-excellence. His mannerisms, not-over the top, certainly not under-acted either - when the moment requires just a perfect tone of darkness, while also keeping it just a tad comedic too, just barely, since after-all, Bryan is a comedian first. There is not a serious scene in the series, which is not without a sense of comedy. Kind of like life is laughing at you as you go from one situation in life to the next. It would not be unfair to say that Bryan could carry the weight of this series, by himself, based entirely on his acting alone. Having said that, it would be easy to overlook the fact that the supporting actors did a great job too, to create an environment in which our anti-hero comes out the best. By the time any series reaches Season 5, there is a sense that franchise has been over-done. A series having a good 4-5 seasons continue on for several more seasons, before they are shut down by channel/studio, due to declining ratings due to viewer fatigue. A good series, eventually fades away from audience memory simply because it went on too long. Then the halt comes, and the characters are gotten rid of expediently to end the series. Not Breaking Bad. This is a series which knew how to stop & when to stop. If the idiom ""quit while you're ahead"", applies anywhere then this series would be it. The penultimate Season 5 is not only the highest point in the series, but as Walter White once said(sic), ""There was a point my life, when if I would have died at that point, it would all have been just perfect."" If you haven't watched it. You should. I am going to watch it for the 3rd time for the lack of anything better on streaming or elsewhere."
10,After many friends recommending me the show i had finally started watching it.. I could not get out of it.. i did not come out of my room for 3 days and completed 5 seasons eventually.. i could not cope with the end of the show and i could not find anything that can top this show.It intensifies season by season.. IT'S ALL ABOUT REACTIONS.. Acting 5/5 Plot 6/5 Score 4/5 Overall feel 22/10 There are no words to describe how great this show is so stop reading this review and start watching it..
10,"I cannot believe that I disregarded this series for nearly 12 years. I assumed that it was yet another American Soap Opera. My son persuaded me to give it a watch. I am so glad that he did. I have been engrossed for the last six weeks watching the full 5 series. I cannot rate this highly enough. The characters, the storyline, the acting, in fact everything about this series was astonishing. Quite frankly I am lost for superlatives by which to describe this production. I will watch it over again in 10 years time when I will be nearly 80. By that time my memory will have begun to deteriorate and it will be like watching it afresh. I can't wait...."
10,"I,ve sawn so many tv shows but this absolutly the Best one, so much action, realistic, good actors as good characters and a thrilling storyline. GOAT Series."
6,"I honestly don't understand all the hype for this show. Probably in 2008 it was a revolutionary series but now in 2021 in my opinion it's not as good as everyone says. In my opinion, the first three seasons are very boring, the fourth is a bit better because it has a lot of epic moments and the fifth season is the one I liked the most and to be honest it's the only one that really interested me. However the characters and their evolutions are incredible and photography and direction are also excellent."
10,"Now I didn't think I would just throw that word around like many other might do about this show, but in reality, upon viewing, I understand why this show is put in such a high regard:Incredibly engaging throughout the whole journey till it's last minute!The show manages to keep nearly every moment profound in the larger scale of things in the world of the show, and does so with amazing pacing that makes you want to watch more. While many shows can be deemed bingable and perhaps well paced, I personally have never experienced story pacing like I have seen in Breaking Bad (apart from maybe a few movies).All storylines, characters, threads and established arcs are wholly completed and play significance till the show hits its last beat. That is what is most incredible; the writers retained coherency and managed to make all of the elements described above matter and ensure that it hasn't wasted your time. A good example of this early on might be the first two seasons, which some people might not initially enjoy because of its less slower pacing. I, along a plethora of viewers, find the two first seasons as excellent as the rest of the show, but when compared, they are technically the weaker part of the show, if you could call it that. But not to worry, these first two seasons are crucial to how the show will end, so if you are reading this: every episode and let alone season matters in the end and will make the viewing experience so much more gratifying.In the end, I could go on about details and reasons why the show is indeed the greatest show of all time, but for simplicity, these are the defining characteristics about the show I found the most pleasing. Simply amazing."
7,The plot line is great... the acting is good... it has all the makings for a great show but for me it was just so dark and depressing I can't call it a favorite.
10,"MY ALL TIME FAVORITE TV SHOW, PERIOD!IT'S GREAT FROM BEGINNING TO END! Yes there are couple episodes that felt like might be filler or the ones that they need to do to control the budget(like the one with the fly in the lab), but it also tells a back story about Mr. White!I've watched it at least 4 times, I kinda lost count! It's just so good, it's scary, it's intense, it's got a good plot. The characters are so well developed and Mr. White is so calculating but you feel his pain of why he did some of the things out of love and some of them out of sins, AGH IT'S AWESOME!The camera movement, how they shot the story, you can tell they really thought about everything. It's just nicely done on top of the great story!LOVE IT!"
10,"I just finished Better Call Saul and went back to rewatch Breaking Bad for a second time. I cannot understate how well written this show is. The scripts are simply incredible. Layers upon layers of great script writing. Deep primal archetypes, set ups, pay offs, reversals, phenomenal dialogue, and characters who are put in jeopardy that have to make smart choices to get themselves out. It's impossible not to root for (and sometimes against) Walter White as he builds a meth empire to provide for his family but slowly turns into a criminal mastermind. I cannot possibly recommend this show enough."
8,"This is a very good show, don't get me wrong... but it's not on par with several HBO shows like ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos""... or even ""Boardwalk Empire""The main problems I have are that many of the decisions made by the main characters are too illogical... the character arcs go up and down and don't feel realistic... Jesse is by far the worst, it feels like Walt should be alot smarter than he actually is... and the two sisters Marie and Skylar are infuriating.Then other characters like Hank and Walter Jr. Are well written and feel so much more realistic... in fact that goes for everyone besides Walt, Jesse, Skylar and Marie... they go from inspiring sympathy to absolute hatred from episode to episode.The best shows on HBO through the years relied on realism and well written characters and the quality difference is enormous from shows on AMC.A good show, maybe the best show for a cable channel... but this doesn't compare to HBO."
10,"To me this is one of the best series ever, you can't stop watching till the end. Capturing story and characters, funny dialogues, good actors. It deserves 10 out of 10."
10,"This might be the best thing I've ever seen... it is 100% the best piece of fiction I've ever seen, but is it the best THING I've ever seen... still deciding. This is the greatest show ever made, and I don't think GOT, The Sopranos, or The Wire will change my mind anytime soon. Every season of this show is gripping and intense, from start to finish. I can't believe I didn't watch this earlier than Feb of 2021. Even though I was too young to see it back when it was on, I still can't believe I watched it this late. I recommend this to anyone who wants to find happiness (or whoever wants to feel all kinds of emotions for that matter) and whoever wants to see one of the biggest and best experiences of their lives."
7,"It has some of the best scenes I ever seen, sadly the whole thing is so streched out that majority of run time is as boring and slow as it could get. Once everywhile something awesome happens, but the wait in between makes me question it's greatness. It's quite a cash grab when you think about it, instead of masterpiece 30-40 episodes they streched it out to 62 to make more money."
7,"Breaking Bad is a good show that is worthy of praise however it is not worthy of iconic status. While it started quite poorly and dragged on in its initial seasons the show certainly improved in the final seasons. Even some of most loyal fans would agree Season 1 had a slow start. Unlike iconic shows that hit the ground running Breaking Bad failed to impress at the start. While the series is about the transformation of a character which came together full circle in the end the series is lucky it never got cancelled at the beginning because of the dullness and unimpressive story lines. Far better shows that showed more promise have not been given the same chance like Breaking Bad but towards the final seasons fans who stuck to the show were rewarded. The series finale has to be the best series finale I have ever seen, it was perfect. Hence I gave a stronger rating. The stars of the show do a great job with their characters and the viewer enjoys the odd and unusual partnership between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. We also have a few solid performances from other characters such as Gus, Walter's brother in law, Hank, and Saul Goodman who hit it out of the park. However other characters such as Skylar White really annoy and frustrate the viewer. Besides her selfishness and coldness she is simply unlikeabale as a character. I do not believe it deserves to be in IMDb's top 10. While many say this show is indeed a journey, it was a boring and rocky journey to begin with. It was initially unimpressive, slow and failed to hit the ground running as great shows often do. A good journey contains valuable nuggets or plots that entices its viewers. It is definitely not in the same league as Game of Thrones which can be regarded as an epic. The spin off show by its creator, Better Call Saul impresses and excels in areas where Breaking Bad falls short. So you better call and watch Saul which is a much better show and showcases far better writing and story lines. Overall a decent show but it definitely saved its best and very memorable acts for the end - 7/10"
8,"I loooved it very much. Everything was just the best. If the series ended with season 4 it will be the best thing i have ever watched. I do not like the last season, it ruined everything, mr. White changed and i didn't liked him anymore."
10,"Yep, this show deserves the top spot. I reviewed a bunch of episodes as I watched them, but now I want to say that the entire show was FANTASTIC!! Even though it is not my personal favorite show, I have to agree that it is one of the best, if not THE best. Everything just WORKED perfectly. The cast, the acting, the characters, the writing, the story, the themes, the ENDING. I cried and laughed and cheered many times. It brought out so many emotions and questions about humanity. My favorite character was Jesse, but all of the characters were great, even the ones I hated (Todd). Every season got better and better as it went on, which is rare for a show. I think five seasons was the perfect amount, and Felina (the finale) was my favorite episode. Everything from the beginning paid off. Watch the show from beginning to end, you will not be disappointed. It is very violent and intense, so make sure you know what you're going into before watching it, but it's so much more than just two people cooking meth in an RV. AMAZING show! 10/10."
6,The hoopla surrounding this series. I tried to watch it several times and couldn't get thru an episode. I have run out of things ( and having watched BCS which imo was 100 times better) I decided to start further in like episode 3. I'm now on season 3 and I just don't get it? It's ok but best show ever?!? It's very slow ( unless miraculously it gets awesome between now and the end season) it's just ok. It's definitely not a binge worthy show imo. I'm liking it better now I'm seeing characters from BCS ( whom act completely different except Gus) it's just underwhelming to me. If somehow it gets incredible between now and 5 I'll update this.
10,This is a masterpiece! Sons Of Anarchy and Breaking Bad my favourite TV shows of all time. I just don't know which one I like better. 🤔
10,"This is, in my opinion, the best show ever written start to finish. I avoided the show during its heyday due to all the hype, and watched it after the fact. Not a single show will leave you as satisfied as Breaking Bad does start to finish. Once you get sucked into the story, there's no looking back. There are other great shows out there... Game of Thrones, Sopranos, Lost, etc..but what all of them tend to suffer from, is a drop off in quality at some point and a weak ending.Breaking Bad does not suffer from this. Season one is as good as Season 5. And the finale is so good.My only single gripe, is that the neo-nazi characters did not compel me as much as the previous season villains, but the show still was as strong as ever, if not the most intense ever, as we neared the final conclusion.Find time to watch it, you won't regret it."
10,"The best series I have ever watched, the best thing that distinguishes the series is that the level of the series continues to rise to the last episode and the series has finished perfectly. The story of the series The series may seem simple, but it becomes deeper and better in the coming seasons. Acting in the series was great from almost all the actors, the best My characters in the series are Walter White, Mike, Gus Fring, and Saul, while the worst characters in the series were Walter Jr., Skyler and Marie, and I was amazed at some of the people who hated Walter because he kills and deceives people in the series. The series is realistic and this is what defines the series, and some of these people put their account picture in the picture of the Joker or Thomas Shelby who did worse things than Walter did. The series is the best series you have ever watched and I recommend watching it. You may feel bored in the first season, but other seasons are getting better and evaluate the seasons. The first is 8/10, the second is 8.8 / 10, the third is 9/10, the fourth is 9.5 / 10, and the fifth is 9.9 / 10. My evaluation of the series in general is 9.7 / 10"
10,"It's great. It's what people have always wanted from crime drama; it's about pride, desperation, decision, obsession, escalation, and the toll on relationship--including relationship with one's self--that ensues.The writing is great. On rare, rare occasions there might be a shadow of a false note; either an ""off"" usage, or a foray into character exploration that seems a little ill-considered. But even these add genuine color to the product. Think of them as a blue tinge to a very pure artistic product.The production values are great, and all personnel deliver, from top to bottom. As I write they're rolling out the final half of season 5; just saw episode 10, and it utterly rips your heart out.Breaking Bad will go down as classic television; amongst the best ever."
2,A boring slow-moving show filled with characters that have no saving Grace whatsoever.
10,"I usually do not watch TV, and I happened to catch the first episode of Breaking Bad while flipping channels. After watching the first episode I was completely hooked. For me, there are only a few TV shows which can do that. I was lucky to catch the first episode from the beginning. For the ones who missed, the first season DVD is out now. Go buy it.Breaking Bad is a dark psychological drama (although actually it doesn't really fit into any genre easily..) with some great moments of equally dark humour. Right now, I think it is different from anything else on TV. The story line is certainly nothing that has ever been done before. It is all original.The cast are all exceptional and the casting is spot on. Bryan Cranston is absolutely brilliant portraying average middle class dad, Walt. He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force. Excellent performance from an excellent actor. Similarly, as Walt's former student Jesse, Aaron Paul shows what a great actor he is. This also goes for Dean Norris who I last saw him in Starship Troopers, long time ago. He does an outstanding job as Hank.Overall it is definitely great television... and is incredibly addicting."
10,"I remember when this show first came out and I just couldn't help but gush over how good it is, even to my mom... who I knew for a fact would never watch a show about ""this type of stuff."" Anything like The Sopranos or anything related to a show about a drug kingpin just wasn't her cup of tea. With that being said... my mom binged all 62 episodes in under two weeks (a few summers ago). I was astounded.We both watched ""Better Call Saul"" together shortly afterwards... and enjoyed it just as much.Breaking Bad (and Better Call Saul too!) really is just one of those shows where you simply forget about the drug part(s). It's more about the human element and how far a person can go... doing what they believe is right... for their family.Bravo to Vince Gilligan. Obviously not giving much away but, yes. It's THAT good. Relatable, well-written MUST watch TV - of all time."
10,"I'm in my fifties and have watched enough television programs and movies that nearly every fictional story I see is repetitively and transparently predictable. I know how it's going to turn out before the halfway point, because Hollywood just keeps regurgitating the same story lines and scripts ad nauseam. But when I watch Breaking Bad, I find virtually ZERO predictability. I am completely locked-in through every episode because the plot always manages to deviate from the expected. And yet it does so, for the most part, without seriously challenging rational beliefs. I think this show is an absolute masterpiece, and the kind of gem that is too rarely encountered in the garbage-filled thousand-channel morass that is television today. Breaking Bad should be considered the absolute benchmark for serial dramatic programming."
10,"As far as television shows go, nothing will ever top the masterpiece that is Breaking Bad. This show excells in so many areas it's crazy, start off with the characters for instance, the acting in this show is phenomenal, I loved every second I spent watching that I even dived into Better Call Saul & El Camino.The character development is insane, we meet Walter Hartwell White, a chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer, its so interesting watching a shy push over man turn into a drug kingpin. Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul absolutely killed it. I have to say though Mike will always be my favourite of all, what a character.I'd highly recommend this, it's absolutely insane."
10,"After the last and utterly disappointing season of Game of Thrones it's finally crystal clear that Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show ever made. Vince Gilligan and the fellow incredible writers of Breaking Bad please save Game of Thrones and team up with HBO to remake the utterly disappointing season 8. We can only dream that much though. Breaking Bad on the contrary with Game of Thrones ended on a very high note that complemented the quality of the previous seasons and even surpassed them. Breaking Bad is a monolithic milestone of television and cinematic art form in general and quite possibly the greatest character study and arc ever presented on the cinematic medium. Breaking Bad serves as an enchanting vignette of sin, the importance of family, power and its corrupting influence, envy and regret, evolution and decay, rise and fall and this seamlessly intertwined amalgamation of brilliant direction, impeccable writing, gorgeous and stylish cinematography, excellent soundtrack, incredible pacing, intricate plotting, captivating story, very extensive thematic depth, rich characterization and exquisite performances put on by its stellar cast, all contribute into making one of the greatest and pieces of cinema ever made with some of the finest characters ever written. With GoT out of the way Breaking Bad solidifies itself as the greatest TV show of all time with the Wire being a close second on my list."
10,Breaking bad is stellar in so many ways. And there's so much to it you have to watch it several times. I've watched it 4 times now. Everytime I watch it I see something new.
10,"In the past two years, I have binged many TV shows. (Mad Men, The Sopranos, Deadwood, Twin Peaks, The Wire, Six Feet Under, The Twilight Zone etc. etc.) I'm always watching something, new or old. And the show that started it all was Breaking Bad. This is the show I always come back too every year. Right now I am currently re watching it for the 3rd time and I've finally come to the conclusion that this is the greatest show of all time. Why is it so amazing?The characters. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are two of the greatest TV characters ever conceived. they're both really strong and well developed characters. Walter at the start of the series has a heart like Mr Rogers and then he slowly evolves into Scarface as the series progresses. Walt always ropes Jesse into doing his dirty work, making his life horrible as the days go by.This series to me has NO BAD EPISODES and NO BAD SEASONS. I could recount the plot for every episode of this show if I wanted to. 3rd time watching already and this show has never bored or failed to disappoint me once. The show gets better every season. The characters get stronger every season.The Acting in this show is phenomenal. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is one of the greatest performances ever. Anna Gunn's convincing performance as Skylar White, what else is there too say, she's one of TV's greatest b*tch characters. Aaron Paul's presence in the series. It's just one great blend.This series is as addictive as the blue meth in the show. It always keeps you engaged and will always push the limit. Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show ever made. If you haven't seen it, it's never too late."
10,"Bryan Cranston as Walter White truly delivers in this series masterpiece about a science teacher, diagnosed with a terminal illness who is looking towards other ways to make an income. That way being... manufacturing meth.It leads down some dark and dangerous paths and his relationship with Jessie Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul is nothing short of beautiful. It's a stressful show to watch as Walter deals with some less than savory characters and as you can imagine, finds himself in prickly situations.The series is captivating and tragic. There's not a single dull moment with major kudos to the writers and directors. 10/10."
10,"No movies even come close to this challenging, mind and soul bending, character study of various mobsters converging in the most desperate times to an intricate climax where truth will be revealed that echoes into eternity.Greatest piece of film art in three decades, hands down. You have to go back to Pulp Fiction in 1994 to find something this unique, original, yet competent enough to become a legit masterpiece.All Hail the King."
9,"I was a bit reluctant to start watching this, because of the subject material. But after a few episodes I was hooked. Each season seems to improve and Vince Gilligan is a master at weaving plots, with seemingly insignificant details that later become key devices in the storyline. It's a story about evil, greed, deceit and innocence betrayed. I'd give it a 10 but there are quite a few developments in the final season that are so far beyond belief and stretch all levels of incredulity that makes BB border on being cartoonish."
10,Vince gilligan is genius bryan cranston is a monster who is thinking about this comidian actor is gonna be the greatest actor in TV history
5,"I finished the show about 3 weeks ago, and I have to ask... Why does everyone seem to love it so much? In my book, it never came close to leaving a mark on television history. The only reason I finished it is because I was persuaded into doing so.. And admittedly, I was a little curious about how it would end with Aaron Paul's character. Which by the way, is a fantastic actor. And the same thing could be said about the rest of the crew.So I'm not saying that the acting is bad, neither is the writing. In fact, it's brilliant. The whole concept is brilliant in it's very own way. It had a very realistic touch to it. So I don't blame the actors, I don't blame the writing team or the producers.. I blame this generation!!!You're not supposed to watch television solely because of the acting or the story.. You're not supposed to watch television because of the realism.. You're supposed to watch it because you want to escape the boring everyday routines that haunts us all, aka real life!!Despite the brilliance of this show, it was barely entertaining at all. It had some moments that's worth remembering, but overall I found it dull and boring.. Probably the most overrated show of the century. Cheers!"
10,"Fantastic story and character development. Season 1 is a little slow but it pays off. Amazing acting by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, and others. I really recommend this show. Also stop hating on the fly episode, it has great meaning if you dig deep enough.Also stop comparing BB to GOT. They are completely different shows and you cannot decide which one is better than the other. They are both fantastic shows."
10,"Breaking bad is possibly the best show ever created, from it's acting to it's writing. Almost every single aspect of this show amazing and it's great from start to finish. It has action, tragedy, comedy, and even more in every single episode. From season 1-5, it spills with creativity. As mentioned before, it even pulls of comedy in some ways in most episodes. It's characters are so realistic as well; some of the best acting ever seen, likely some of the best acting ever aired on TV. It's so great I would rate it an 11/10 if I could! What the hell are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and go watch the damn thing!"
4,"9.5?! Seriously??!! This is probably the most overrated series of all time. I only like the last two season, the first three are very very slow and boring."
5,"I resisted watching this show while it was on air. I hate things that are hyped because they tend to be let downs.I suffered through the first two season and said that was enough of my life I was willing to give to Mr. White and his do-boy Pinkman. I just didn't get what was so sensational about this show revolving around a middle age white guy who decides to make meth. The character development was so weak I didn't care or root for anyone and I didn't understand Walt's desperate desire to leave money for his family who were two-dimensional and whinny. What was extremely annoying was the dragging out of things out over multiple episodes. Case in point, Crazy 8. Did his act really require 3 episodes?? That time could've been better spent trying to establish a legitimate connect. No we have to watch these clowns bumble their way into the drug business, which Pinkman was already firmly entrenched, for darn near nine episodes. Put a fork in me, I'm breaking bad and not giving this overrated show anymore of my time."
10,"Bow down to the Greatest Of All Time Series 🙌there's no doubt in it. Believe it THE HYPE IS REAL FOR THE SERIES. This series is perfect from every end. Acting, Story, Dialogues, Cinematography, Sound, Editing everything is perfectly executed 🔥. Vince Gilligan creator of this masterpiece is truly a mastermind. Every actor who played their respective roles / character they just lived in their role & gave their best no doubt in it. From the 1st episode to the last episode is just Mind blowing, no series can be soo perfect like BREAKING BAD. Most of the series fail to be perfect because of the ending or the beginning but... Here the Starting & Ending is perfectly balanced and they have give a proper justice to all the characters in it. Bryan Cranston & Araon Paul the lead actors of the series are the true gems of the series they just lived in their character. Speaking of facts: Aron Paul never went to any Acting classes & won multiple number of awards for his acting.🙌GOAT OF ALL DAMN SERIES🙌"
10,Anyone who says GoT is better than BrBa are living in Delusion.
8,"Watched Breaking Bad a few years ago, was really addicted to it. Watching this series all over again right now during this coronavirus pandemic. Still very enjoyable. It's no doubt top notch TV series. However, this time as I get to the late seasons, somehow I just grow more and more angry about WW by each episode. Sometimes feel an urge to just smash his wrinkled bald head. Feel almost zero empathy towards him. Feel angry about the damage he did to his family and people around him. Yes and the scripts and acting sometimes get a little over-dramatic. This style works better in Breaking Bad than ""Better call Saul"" -- the latter one I had to give up after 2 seasons despite its stellar reviews."
6,I seriously don't get the 9.5 ! The last episode of season 4 was just the perfect ending. Season 5 is so messed up ! So many things do not match up ! So disappointing.
8,Story and screenplay is good. All lead actors did they job. If I really have to be picky then Anna Gunn could have done little better. Bryan & Aaron needs to be called out for making their character believable.
7,"I seriously don't understand why this gets 9.5 stars..... The show is above average at best. Sure, the acting is solid, the story has plot twists and Esposito is great again but 9.5......???? I don't get it......."
10,"""Breaking Bad"" is the darkest show on TV, and possibly the best. The main character, Walt White, is a high school chemistry teacher with cancer, a pregnant wife, a disabled son, and no savings. Hoping to leave a nest egg when he dies, he teams up with a young lowlife and begins cooking crystal meth. Walt and his accomplice are in way over their heads, and get into one harrowing scrape after another, from stranding themselves in the desert to being kidnapped by a psycho drug lord. Deep ironies abound. Walt's double life entangles him in so many lies he can't keep track of them all. This damages his relationship with his family (who were the reason he started cooking meth in the first place). Unforeseen complications keep sabotaging Walt's drug operation and eating into the money he makes. As he puts it, everything is ""one step forward, two steps back."" ""Breaking Bad"" approaches its characters with a penetrating sense of human frailty and zero sentimentality. Though Walt's a sympathetic character, he does many unsympathetic things. His wife, loyal and moral almost to a fault, nurses a secret crush on a former boss. Walt's young accomplice has an inconvenient streak of decency, but not enough to overcome his own essential weakness and stupidity.The hypocrisy and ""quiet desperation"" of middle-class suburban life have been worked to death in books, movies, and TV. ""Breaking Bad"" gives these themes new life with clear-eyed, pitiless characterizations, brilliant acting, gripping plot twists, imaginative visual style, and grim black humor. The nearest analogy I can think of is to Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary."" ""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece."
10,"The most beautiful family drama ever made. Every episode, every season is pure art."
10,"Absolutely one of the most ground breaking bad ass shows on the screen, (pardon the pun). Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.I personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets. How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch. The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone. I hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them). From the writing and production sets to the acting, costumes, lighting, filming and originality. I've seen a few good series lost to the wrong decision makers, hope this one doesn't end up short (long live FireFly)Chuckbytes"
8,"When my partner and I finally reached the conclusion of the final episode it genuinely felt like a colossal weight had been lifted off our lives. We'd been watching Breaking Bad, off and on, since 2013 or thereabouts and had been avoiding spoilers with severe intent for years. I'd run away from conversations. I once jumped off a bridge when someone said ""Walt-"". I ONCE LEAPT FROM A ZEPPELIN UPON HEARING THE WORD ""METH"".Rian Johnson said, I think, the most succinct quote on the enduring appeal of Breaking Bad which essentially amounted to ""the characters matter"". For me this has to be the big takeaway here - this was a show, regardless of the overarching themes, regardless of the symbolism and commentary you can read into it, that is fundamentally one of the most undiluted character pieces in television history. Given that Gilligan's original framework was ""what if our protagonist became an antagonist over the course of a show"" it essentially means that character progression is welded into the architecture of the format and it is genuinely beautiful to witness.That is not to say that it doesn't stumble, and its initial season (although hampered and ultimately helped by the writer's strike) is structurally uneven and it's still hard to compress the seven years we watched it to the two years it's meant to be set across. To my mind it also doesn't quite pull off the balance of tension and release til its midpoint - and fails to really perfect it until the flawless final season. I've also had scores of people telling me they much prefer its more tonally rounded prequel Better Call Saul - which is absolutely fair enough as Gilligan himself admits that the final pitch-black descent was extremely uncomfortable to follow through on.At its best though, there really isn't anything else like it, another jewel in the crown of the medium and certainly deserving of all the hype it gets. Like one of Jesse's perfectly crafted, meticulously constructed imaginary wooden boxes. Yes it's now a weight off the mind, but a rather wonderful one. I'll still leap from zeppelins of course, because I DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED FOR THE SOPRANOS."
10,"I saw some of the 1 star reviewers and I have to say, those folks must be really dull to be around! It's obvious they didn't even watch it. The show is so intense and edge of your seat especially when it really gets going.. very smart writing because of the character development"
10,"PERFECT SHOW. Nothing more. Nothing less.I kept wondering why Breaking Bad is considered as the best show ever made. I kept asking myself what makes this receive that high of a reception. It's not like it has any visual elements to keep your attention or anything.This show deserves the Universal acclaim for it's unique linear-take of story-telling. Let me tell you, after i've watched this, i felt an intense feeling. A feeling of incomprehension or something or i don't know. At first, i was like, yeah sure it's good and all. But not groundbreaking or anything. I watched BB almost exactly an year ago, in August 2020. But now, when i re-watched it, it hit immensely different, like my-rating-went-from 8.9-to-9.4-way different.WALTER WHITE is a character of the CENTURY. The way Bryan portrays Walter weighs equal to some legendary statue of someone, im tellin' you.The shows makes a simplified linear plot point into a complex variety. Breaking Bad is a phenomenal drama in TV. Vince Gilligan made something fabulous! That's it. He made SOME-THING. A revolution in TV.Thanks for this!! Never forget!"
10,Easily the best TV show i have ever watched! This show is a true king of shows.
6,"The first three seasons are boring, there are so many unnecessary scenes!! Then it gets better especially in the last season. Directing and acting are phenomenal."
10,This show will sit in the upper echelons of TV shows for generations to come. Like the Sopranos it helped shape TV and helped set the benchmark for the competition. It will certainly take a special show to de-throne this. Utterly re-watchable even if you chose to do so once or more a year.
3,The story is interesting and well developed but the pace is too slow. There are too many unnecessary scenes and filler episodes.
5,"In general, the acting by all in Breaking Bad is fantastic. However, the quality and range of acting by Aaron Paul is truly amazing. Bryan Cranston is getting a lot of attention, which is expected from a veteran actor with his experience. However, it's Aaron Paul's outstanding performance that demonstrates the remarkable capacity, among a new generation of actors, to reveal a world of extreme complexities and harsh realities that we find in today's America.Aaron Paul's ability to bring to life these contemporary elements is the test of any great actor, at any age. Indeed, Breaking Bad brings a valuable contribution to the realm of quality Television Theater, and Aaron Paul's work here is among the finest to come forward in a long while. Bravo, Mr. Paul!UPDATE: Great news! Aaron Paul has just won his first Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, at the Annual Primetime Emmy Awards 2010! Congratulations Mr. Paul! ~ e"
10,"This story is unique, Walter White gets cancer and must support his family somehow right? Why not make money the illegal way...The acting is top notch, the effects are top notch, the story is superb, the characters are memorable and believable.There is 5 seasons here, 62 episodes total, so its a long story that has to be told, buckle up and get invested because you will love this story.Every season is a 10/10 for me, everything is believable and well thought out.My biggest gripe with the show is Walter's wife Skyler, her character arc makes my blood boil, but its totally believable how she treats Walter through out the story."
10,"Breaking Bad could be considered the best TV Show of all time, mainly due to its consistency. Breaking Bad has been equally great through every season. The acting, characters, story, pacing, everything is amazingly done. The only issue that I have with the show is that it gets a little redundant in the middle seasons. But an issue like that changes from person to person, so depending on your interest, you might get hooked, or loose interest near the end. But aside from that, the show practically has no problems. So if you're in need of a good show to watch, Breaking Bad should be the first pick."
2,"I have no idea why people like this show. I cannot find a single redeeming trait, not one. The acting is horrible, the characters unlovable, the story-line crap, the directing idiotic, nothing about this show works for me. I have tried to watch it so many times because so many love this show, but honestly the show gets worse for each try I make. Also tried to jump around a bit and check out the most celebrated episodes a couple of extra times, but nah, nothing. I seldom hand out a one (1), I save those for the worst crap ever made such as The Flash, so I will give this a 2, but that feels too much."
10,I hesitated to watch this but I soon as I got it recommended to me I got time to watch it and I can never see a better show than this ever again.I like how it made you sit the edge of the couch every episode and they wasn't not a episodes that didn't have at least a 8+ rated for me.
10,And i can understand why its considered the bestdef better than sopranos.
10,"Hopefully there will be better series in the future, but not up till now. The GARBAGE that is Game of Thrones season 8 and the way that season ruined the entire series made me appreciate BB all anew. The best series hitherto, easily."
10,It has been said Breaking Bad is the perfect example on how to write a perfect script. That couldn't be more true.
10,The best thing in the series is the actors and the story and every thing its amazing show
5,"It was a good show , not the worst I've seen obviously, but it was kinda boring to watch. Any ""plot twist"" they tried was pretty obvious, and I really couldn't engage with the characters or care for them as I thought I would before watching it . You already know what's going to happen in the beginning of every season , and to be fair , it's not worth the hype . Walt and Jesse's relationship is just the weirdest thing I've ever seen... and Skyler is just awful . It's a good show , watch it if you have the time and want , but there are others that are way more addicting and better written."
10,"So instead of reading this review, go watch it for the 10th time."
10,"This is what perfection looks like folks, I'm not a huge tv show fan, I think a lot of tv shows go overlong due to the appeal, money, and attention, breaking bad though, delivers 100% and more. The rewatch value is insane. The show pays off through every weak point you may feel pays off. Breaking Bad does more than break bad, it breaks the barrier that most tv shows can't seem to break through. It breaks through the cliches, trends and overlong played out seasons, ending in a actual ending. Instead of leaving so much questions behind it actually finishes. It is an amazing show period and the greatest tv show ever."
6,"Entertaining, but way over the top. Could the whole of the US really be this bad Haha"
10,"What sets Breaking Bad apart from other television shows is its incredible writing, direction, and acting. The characters are complex and nuanced, with motivations that are often conflicting and hard to pin down. The plot is meticulously crafted, with each episode building on the last to create a cohesive narrative that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is nothing short of remarkable. He perfectly captures the character's transformation from a meek and mild-mannered teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin, showcasing a range of emotions and motivations that are both compelling and heartbreaking.The supporting cast is equally strong, with standout performances from Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn as Walter's wife Skyler, and Giancarlo Esposito as the menacing drug lord Gus Fring. The show also boasts some of the best cinematography, editing, and music in television history, creating a unique and immersive viewing experience.What makes Breaking Bad truly remarkable, however, is its willingness to tackle complex themes such as morality, power, and the consequences of one's actions. The show never shies away from the darkness of its subject matter, but it also manages to find moments of humor, humanity, and redemption amidst the chaos.In short, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece of television that is sure to stand the test of time. It's a show that demands your attention and rewards your investment, and it deserves a perfect 10 out of 10 rating."
10,It's one of the best series I watched. It starts slowly but gets really interesting to watch and find out how it'll finish. A must watch. All actors are great.
10,"I've watched a lot of TV, movies, etc. But this is the best. You can watch it all. Then few years later (or sooner) you can go back and rewatch it all. It's the gift that keeps on giving. The best TV has to offer."
10,Vince Gilligan take a bow what an incredible show. I can't name one thing bad about this show it's a masterpiece of television.
10,"I never really fell too deeply in love with any show until I watched Breaking Bad. This show is special. The story was just so great, the acting was spectacular, and Vince Gilligan did such an incredible job directing. I've never seen acting as good as Brian Cranston was as Walter White. Every season ended with such a bang. The ending to the entire show was so good. I couldn't pick one thing to change about anything with this show. I even plan on naming my dog Heisenberg. This is truly the greatest show of all time and I don't think I could ever adore a show as much as I did with Breaking Bad."
10,"Amazing show. None of the other TV shows have matched up to the excellence of this one. Such an unconventional plot, also giving us a profound message!Screenplay, storyline, acting everything is nothing less than stellar.I hope that people would make many more shows with such impactful storyline and some real life lessons.This series gives out a strong message of being less judgemental of anyone, even if they cross the conventional protocol of the society.Walter White led his entire life walking on the staight line that society had drawn for him. He was extraordinary in his line of work with unconditonal passion for Chemistry. Even then he gets treated as an underdog like most of the real life heros.He was fearful of everything in life, till he discovers about his lung cancer which in turn makes him break bad."
10,"I am not into Television series. This was my first attempt and boy, did it blow my mind!Every single factor about Breaking Bad is so fine and original and startling, I was addicted to it and still am. I could, if time permits, watch all episodes again and again. That is why the 100%, because this show can even make the most boring person find a reason to get smart.With so much swag, the characters are well-written. Bryan Cranston is simply outstanding. Supporting cast is brilliant and the airs they carry with the portrayals is so charming, it is very hard to believe it is fiction. Aaron Paul's facial expressions, Dean Norris' funny physique and his laugh snorts, Anna Gunn's OMG emotions & her beauty are all simply amazing. RJ Mitte is fantastic.Now, for the story, it is gold and this one shines, too. Every episode reveals something new about the chemistry involved in cooking crystal-drug, Walter White's familial problems and all that comes along. The little to grave dangerous adventures the two main characters set on towards the end of Season 1 is mind-boggling. And with the high- level of crime involved... I mean all sorts of crimes... the boldness overflows threshold and that is what works here!The music, the cinematography, the direction & the cast performance together puts up to the startling birth & departure of a very good TV series. ""Better Call Saul"" will be good, eh?BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! And if you are planning to start a new series to watch, make it Breaking Bad! This is some serious entertainment stuff!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOProfanity: Strong | Vulgarity/Sex/Nudity: Strong | Violence/Gore: Very Critical | Smoking/Alcohol/Drugs: Infinity | Porn: Very Mild"
10,Each season gets better and better. The story unfolds perfectly and the characters are all incredible.
10,"I can't describe how this show made me feel. I went through all the emotions while watching it, and when I finished it, the only thing I could feel was emptiness. I just wanted to erase it from my memory so I could watch it as if it was the first time.I got very attached to the characters and seeing the entire journey and decline of Walt and Jesse was incredible but devastating at the same time.All the characters are extremely important and deep. Certainly Walt and Jesse were the most impactful characters, Walt is one of the best characters ever created, and despite him being an idiot and destroying the lives of everyone around him, you just can't hate him, because everything that involves him leaves you fascinated. And Jesse is just the sweetest person in the world, I would easily die for him, he didn't deserve anything bad that happened to him and he's a character that you can feel empathy for and get attached to.(Jesse, you deserve the world)"
3,"I made it to Episode 6 of season 2.I am finished now...As the title says, this is a horrible show full of horrible people, I simply could not connect with any of them, it bums me out after every episode and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, episode 6 of season 2 (Peekaboo) finished me off, I am not prepared to watch things like that if there is no balance (at least there is no balance for me, some people may find the ""lighter"" moments good, but I didn't) The show is just constantly depressing.The acting is ""ok"" at best, the jokes are not really funny, the drama is annoying and has a ""seen it all before"" feel to it, and all the characters are selfish, miserable, stupid ar$e-holes.People say this is the best show of all time, hmmm, I don't think so, this is not even in the same league as The Sopranos, and is certainly not as good as: Walking dead, Dexter, Game of Thrones, Mad Men and a few others I could name.I give it 3 stars because there were one or two moments of decent comedy, and the occasional bit of good writing, but how this stinking turd comprised of human misery rates so high generally is beyond me."
10,"No review here!I'm just here to say that go for it! Literally just go for it!!It'll your worth time!But just keep in mind that don't hurry for thrill in first 2 seasons. There's more after that. After you have successfully completed 2 seasons with patience, you are ready to jump into thrill!"
3,I gave this until the first episode of season 3. I understand that Walt is supposed to be an antihero but you should still care about the character. I couldn't find a single redeeming quality in any character. I was so disappointed to have wasted 20 hrs of my life.
9,"Updated.Stick to this series! S1 AND S2 will bore you out (it's still true that a few episodes could be squeezed into 1) but come S3, things just got more exciting and episodes have become more interesting to watch. What I like about the series is a VERY SOLID storyline. Simple and not that complex thus giving opportunity for an elaborate plot."
10,Oh Vince Gilligan! What have you done?Why make such a perfect show that after watching this no other show feels the same anymore. How can this be so perfect ?Instead of starting another TV show I simply keep watching it all over again. Someone help me.
10,"I used to be one of those people that got easily pleased by everything in media, enjoyed it, and ignored writing flaws. Then I watched this show, observed the writing and direction and realized that THIS is what high quality writing looks like. Ever since, I've been a harsh critic of TV and Film. Unless it has Breaking Bad quality writing, I'll criticize it to bits. Which is why I barely watch modern television anymore. I'm stuck in the good old days of TV. I thought that GOT was on par with Breaking Bad's level of writing in it's first 3-4ish seasons. But that writing quality been going down a drain since S5. This show has made it clear. THIS is the staple of what all modern TV shows and movies should strive to be. Cohesive, immerseful, thoughtful and entertaining.Hats off to you Vince Gilligan. Hats off to you and the BRILLIANT cast!Best show I've ever watched. I'm on marathon #10 or something"
10,"I've never seen anything like this before. These so far two seasons about a man, a father, a husband, a chemical-teacher who gets cancer and start to try out as a drug dealer is a step-by-step-analysis of which consequences this decision can have on your life, family and friends. It's a emotionally roller-coaster ride without big gun shoot-outs or explosions though it shows that many mean things are getting to control your life.This show doesn't fill every clichéd that is connected to a drug dealer story so it can reach it's sure audience. No! It tries to figure out (and of course it never can be reality, but it's trying to get as close as it can) how to deal with these chliches when they're suddenly entering and ruling your ordinary, normal, average life.You cannot call this a movie, though you'd like to, because it's the only thing that you can relate to that ever reached such quality. And this is why I don't want to devalue Breaking Bad just to a TV- Series that can be seen randomly on TV. Again: No! It's 15 Hours of high quality. It's 15 Hours of the best thing made out of picture and sound ever made. It's 15 Hours of Art. Art in Directing. Art in Cinematography and especially Art in Writing and Acting.I love it!"
5,"With all the TV I have watched in my lifetime, this one show is my favorite of all time. It has everything: great acting, great writing, it's exciting and intelligent. There is not a single wasted moment, not a single predictable lazy/clichéd storyline in the entire show.When I first started watching, I must admit I was turned off. The show seemed dark, depressing and bleak. I mean come on... some boring middle-aged white dude working two jobs, putting up with his bitchy wife, a special-needs son, AND cancer? But as the plot goes on, it's soon becomes quite inspiring. What it all comes down to is that this is a story about an emasculated, downtrodden man who finds his mojo. The cancer is his wake-up call; Facing death in the face, he finally begins to embrace life. Watching the transformation is a joy to behold.Now, I am sure many would protest how I have characterized the show here. It is typical for Walt's character development to be described as as a downward spiral into evil, selfishness, and narcissism. And he does indeed have moments, particularly in the last seasons, where he seems to have hit the moral rock bottom. But I think when you go out and live life to fullest, you have to accept that sometimes you are going to make mistakes, sometimes you'll have to be the bad guy.In any case, you don't have to like Walt's character to like the show. In this show there are no heroes, definitely some villains, but no heroes. In many stories there is often a trade-off between action and character development; either you have a slow plodding show with great 3-dimensional characters, or an action-packed explosion-fest with little character development or nuance in the direction. But this show has it all; Every single episode has such tight cinematography, excellent dialogue and characterizations, every episode makes you hungry to see the next one and see what happens next. The way the plot unfolds with its ups and downs, exciting moments and slow moments, is PERFECT.I'm not going to go through every character, they all did a great job, but I have to single out Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse. I think he stands out as the greatest acting performance of the show. His youthful, bright-eyed character is the heart and soul of the show, and he could not have done acted it better.So anyway, if you haven't seen this show yet, I envy you, because you get to see it for the first time and I can't again. I supposed someone might not like the show if they are particularly squeamish about drugs or violence, but even if you are you might like the show anyway."
10,"This is arguably one of the best things created by the human race.Without a doubt the best series of all time. Pure perfection.I gave it a chance, and it won my heart. I wish i could forget the series so i could experience it for the first time again."
10,"""Masterpiece... To be honest, I avoided this series for several years, arguing, 'I'm not ready to see Hal cooking meth.' Big mistake. When I finally decided to watch this TV series, after the first episode, I didn't even remember that character. That's why Bryan Cranston is a magnificent actor, just like his co-stars. This series demonstrates quality from its first to last scene, and that is more than gratifying. The script and main plot evolve into a poetic justice that permeates this legendary story and manages to empathize with characters that are often abject yet infused with so much humanity that it forces us to reassess our morals repeatedly. Like many people, I wish I could erase this series from my memory to experience again the television masterpiece that Vince Gilligan gave us, making us feel as alive as Heisenberg was with his 'baby blue.'"""
10,"Outstanding writing, with amazing characters and performances from the actors. A beautiful blend of realistic crime drama and dark comedy. Also some of the most unique cinematography I've ever seen in a show or movie. One of the greatest shows of all time!!"
10,"Everything that's brilliant about it has already been said.For people who previously couldn't decide between this and GoT, well now you know.For GoT fans who dare rate this 1/10 out of spite and bitterness, SHAME ON YOU.Did you know that the (incompetent) makers of GoT looked up to Breaking Bad and wanted to have a series finale that's as GOOD as it had?Well they FAILED miserably.Breaking Bad is superior.Brilliant from BEGINNING to END.And THAT is why it is the BEST."
10,"Breaking Bad has marked forever the tv shows industries, and for good reasons. Insanely good character development, great and well-placed action scenes, an inside look into the mind of a narcissistic, crazy, lost chemistry teacher who has found the thrill of life in being the biggest drug producer of New Mexico. Walter White is terrible, but we root for him, we root so hard for him it's crazy. Gustavo may be one of the most interesting and terrifying antagonists in television history.Often with Tv shows, the acting isn't the best, often not to movies level. It's not the case for Breaking Bad. It has by far the best acting I've seen in any Tv shows, no one come's close (for the shows that I've watched).This show marked internet, it marked the world, it marked history."
10,"Saw my headline? Yeah, that's all I can say. Watch it and enjoy the ride. I can watch the entire series again! From episode 1 of season 1 til the very end, it was such a pleasure :) There's a reason the show is so popular. I was sad when i finished it. From a teacher to the great Heisenberg..BITCH! See what I did there? You'll get it soon enough, just watch it :)"
10,Best series ever! My favourite episode is the one with the fly!
10,"I have no clue how this show dropped from a 9.5 to a 9.4 but I can guarantee this is the single best show ever created. There isn't a time where an element doesn't work. This show has amazing actors, characters and a story that has many twists and turns but still manages to be believable with the best and most satisfying ending to any show I have ever watched."
10,"The main contender for the best show of all time. It was at the top of my list for years, but was recently unseated by another show I'll leave unnamed in this review. BB is a priceless piece of modern American art. A rare experience that gives life new meaning. Must see for everyone."
9,"It is a wonder, and a great mistake on my behalf, that I only got around to watch ""Breaking Bad"" now in 2016, because I have really been missing out on something phenomenal. What initially made me stay away from the series back when it was airing was the premise of a cancer-struck teacher making methamphetamine. I mean, how much fun could a TV series about such a thing be? But I was put to shame, multiple times over, because ""Breaking Bad"" is nothing short of extraordinarily spectacular.The series starts out in a very high gear and never really slows down. Which is a very impressive feat, because it is quite a thing to keep it going at such a high and fast pace for 6 seasons without losing momentum.What makes ""Breaking Bad"" so phenomenally good is the combination of a thrilling storyline, interesting and well-fleshed-out characters and a myriad of talents actors and actresses to portray these characters. The storyline and the characters come off as being believable and realistic and that is one of the aspects that really appealed to me. And also that Bryan Cranston was superbly cast for the role of Walter White.I sat through all episodes in all of the six seasons in a very short time, and it seemed like I had just started when I reached the very last episode. A testimony to how compelling and captivating the storyline really was.""Breaking Bad"" combines seriousness and light comedy in a good manner, which does work quite well.The only downside to the series is that it does suffer from predictability. You know what will happen to Walter White and Jesse Pinkman ahead of time, as they are the two main characters. But it is not really a factor that drags down the overall enjoyment of the series in any way. Especially because the director managed to build up the scenes throughout the series in a manner that you really want to see what happens, despite of you already knowing it.Well, there are actually two downsides to the series, come to think of it, and the other being that it is unlikely that you will sit down to watch it a second time, as the series doesn't seem to have that much repeated watching value.If you, like me, have missed out on this TV series, then you really should do yourself a favor and sit down to watch it, because it is really a blast of a TV show."
10,Yes yes I can guarantee you the breaking bad is the best tv show ever and for those who say that it isn't I am sorry for the word but your dumb!!!
9,"If Breaking Bad was the first TV series to ever exist, something incredible certainly would have made history. If it were to be the last show to ever run, that would make it a perfectly historical culmination. However, as it arrived eight years into the 21st Century, it ranks as a game changer for television eternally.None of the films and any other TV show I've seen in my lifetime have impressed me as much as this. It's impossible to describe this series in one word but it deserves to be described with every single positive one ever created on this planet.It's pretty staggering how much creator Vince Gillian and his crew beat the odds to tell a story about a man who rises to crime by cooking drugs after his cancer diagnosis. The way Walter White changes from a family guy to a money-obsessed drug lord is incredible. Okay, its subject matter obviously isn't for the faint of heart but whether you're into that or not, you'll be hooked to this thing like what that disgusting drug does to people.It's not just a crime show, its more than just that. In fact there's so much to obsess over: the character development and dialogue are professionally thought-out and never cheat, the cinematography is experimental, the direction is strong and the locations are beautifully staged. The writing is by far the selling point of the series. The team of ten writers (including Gilligan) know how to keep the story moving from one moment to the next with unstoppable energy while absorbing unique ideas that never feel or become stale and derivative. They also understand how to capture the horrific transformation of a normal human turning evil unhurriedly. Kudos to the directors for translating them onto screen, which is just as impressive due to the fact that their work is so seamless that the audience can become completely unaware of it. Notable directors Rian Johnson (Star Wars: Episode VIII) and David Slade (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse) helm a few episodes which adds as a bonus to the series' success.The storytelling is of the highest order. It's clear Gillian isn't a by-the-numbers storyteller, he cares about characterisation and slow introduction for the colourful and dark world he's created. From the first episode to the very last, nearly every frame roots for the beauty of character-driven narrative as well as artistic cinematography that vaguely shows the beautiful locations in the background. We care for these characters, we follow them, we relate to them in some way. To be truthful, they feel realistic throughout the entire series. If only films adapted this element better.Bryan Cranston is mind-blowing as Walter White. Anchored by the writing, he sets the character up perfectly as he gets sucked into the criminal underworld. His attitude towards everyday life slowly begins to change throughout the series, and it's played beautifully. Aaron Paul is awesome as Jesse Pinkman, portraying an uneven post-student drug addict in all the best ways. He's funny, argumentative but you also oddly enough care for him in many parts of the show. Dean Norris is top-notch as DEA brother-in-law Hank. He plays a little with comedic attitude throughout the first couple of seasons but that slowly fades away as the story gets darker. Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte are spectacular at wife Skyler and son Walter, Jr. They have the characteristics to support a normal family before all hell breaks loose. If they're any flaws, there is perhaps only one. While the cinematography is stylistic, the first half of the series is viewed from a hand-held perspective, making the experience sometimes slightly frustrating but luckily later on it turns to the camera placement that I can handle. Without giving anything away, the finale is anything but average which is a low for the show. It doesn't have the same richness that the pilot had, but hey, you can't have everything.A TV series can go on for years or maybe decades, but what this did so damn well was that it finished exactly when it needed to. In an age where shows are dragged until completely decreased quality, this is a triumph. Gilligan chose wisely.Crime does not pay but Breaking Bad certainly pays the price, thanks to the indescribable and unthinkable effort of the entire production anchored by a true discovery in television: Vince Gilligan. I doubt we'll see anything like this again."
10,Breaking Bad is by far the best show of all time. The drama. The character development. The acting. The build up. The suspense. Everything about it is just perfect!
10,"the BEST TV DRAMA SERIES of ALL TIME Breaking Bad After so many lugubrious turns, ""Breaking Bad"" came to an end on Sunday on an almost uplifting note.Running since 2008..5 Glorious SEASONS & 62 clinching EPISODES & rating of 9.5/10 on IMDb & 99/100 on Metacritic it ended with the MOST SATISFYING FinalE ever..Watched by 10.3 million viewers.A simple story of a chemistry teacher making blue meth for providing his family with his former student teaches us every important meaning of LIFE.With very REAL/GREAT/EXTRAORDINARY performance by Bryan Cranston & created by Vince Gilligan this TV Series blowned my MIND..totally.I have watched so many Great English TV Series like The Walking Dead, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Supernatural, Firefly & Sherlock also but this was PURE GENIUS.All Hail The King HEISENBERG!!!"
10,After watching the last season of GOT I think we can make it official - Breaking Bad is the GOAT. Superior writing and character development. Fantastic drama in every episode. Only wish it could have gone on longer.
10,"Most TV series exist in a state of enforced stasis, minor changes to the status quo and a character death here and there keep might keep things fresh but ultimately as a viewer you might watch them on an episode to episode basis without thinking too far ahead. There are however a select few series which have set out trying to tell a complete unified story in which every event has a bearing on the overall picture of the tale, and everything from episode one to the finale might feel planned. I'd include Game of thrones, Mr Robot, The Americans etc. in this category. This means that you get this sense of falling further and further down the rabbit hole as you watch each episode. For creators, this is the hardest thing to pull off, it must take incredible discipline and patience. To this day I'd argue that there's only one TV series that has achieved this huge novelistic structure without losing momentum or going astray at some point in its long run. I am of course talking about Breaking Bad. From the first episode Breaking Bad knows what it's about and from there on it unfolds like a great big pulpy novel. Each season doesn't end in a finale which wraps things up only for the story to have to find a new beginning in it's next outing, but instead ends with just an episode (Invariably an incredible one) that raises the stakes for the next season and subtlety moves the story into the next act in a way that feels natural. There's a beginning, a middle and an end. And the protagonist's arc is clearly sign posted all the way through to the story's astounding, devastating final act.When you reach the end of Breaking Bad you feel as though you've completed a long journey in the best way possible. Few series (or even movies for that matter) can match it for being just so stuffed with artistic craft. Everything is just tip top from the writing to the acting. Even while the visuals may not be able to match some of the bigger budget blockbuster series like game of thrones or Westworld for shear spectacle, they are instead meticulous in their creativity in a way those other series don't quite match. We're treated to beautiful wide angle shots of an omnipresent New Mexico desert, but also with close ups of little details most showrunners would simply ignore. Attention to these details is perhaps the thing which makes breaking bad so compelling. I personally always loved the look of the show for its grainy, high contrast, natural lighting style of cinematography. It's notably shot on film in a world increasingly turning to the clear look of digital. This all (alongside directing which is always imaginative) helps to bring out a wild western pulpy quality reminiscent of the work of Leone or Tarantino.There a few series I hold closer to my heart than all the rest (The Leftovers, The Sopranos, Twin Peaks, Mad Men etc.), but still, 7 years after I finished Breaking Bad, it remains my ultimate TV experience and the only series I've seen that never put so much as a foot wrong over its 5 season run. I recommend giving it the most cinematic viewing you can. Find a big screen with a good sound system and settle in for a rare top to bottom TV masterpiece."
10,"This is the most consistently good show ever made. At its worst, its great, at its best, its, well, the best. Ever. If you haven't watched it, what are you doing? Go watch it. Chances are somebody you know has been nagging you to watch it, just get it over with already."
10,I can not describe how i felt sad when it ends. Vince Gilligan is a genius. I've never seen such talented actors like Aaron Paul & Bryan Cranston. Suggest you see.
5,"I had high expectations for this series because everyone says it's a masterpiece. It took me 2 months to finish the first season, too boring !! The second and third seasons are a little better but they are still very boring. The fourth and fifth seasons are the best but there are still some episodes that are very boring. And most of the episodes don't even end on a cliffhanger so I wasn't even interested in seeing the episode later..."
10,"We've watched it all the way through. Several times. And I could still watch it again.Even years later, this is the best show you'll ever watch. Even the ""filler"" episodes are good and well written. Can't say that about any other shows.This was truly the peak of TV, and things have slowly gone downhill ever since."
10,Just wanted to say that I'm very lucky that in my teen hood my eyes got blessed with this epic show.
10,"I can't say how incredible it is. I didn't know that I'm addicted to BrBa until it ended and then, nothing was good enough to watch."
10,I never wanted to compare GOT and BB But GOT fked up in last season but Breaking Bad was super until the end and that was the most osm part of this series.I loved Breaking Bad and Walter white
10,"The perfect TV show doesn't exist. Vince Gilligan: ""Hold my coffee.""At first I was sceptical about Breaking Bad , because people were so extremely hyped about it. It can't be that good, right? Boy, was I wrong. One of my main concerns was Bryan Cranston. Or as I knew him at the time: Hal from Malcom in the Middle. A TV show I grew up with. I quickly forget his past due to his amazing acting and now know him as Walter White and Heisenberg.Breaking Bad did many things perfect in it's 5 seasons. Every single actor managed to play their part and nobody slipped up. And the quality never dipped in 5 seasons. I don't know how they did it, but Breaking Bad managed to stay great from beginning to end. And more importantly they went out with a bang. They could've easily dragged the show on for 3 or 4 more seasons and earned way more money, but instead they chose to end Breaking Bad on a high note.I can recommend this TV show to every single person. Avoid spoilers at all costs if you haven't seen the show and enjoy the ride!"
10,"Breaking bad is well written, well directed, all the actors are incredible, the whole team does an excellent job on this entire series. You feel (whether good or bad) for every single character on this show, the character arcs and development are works of art. This series will always sit on my top 5 list. If you haven't seen it, get to it!"
10,The beat show of all time and the best ending of all time
10,"Out of this trainwreck of a year, I did discover one good thing. I had just finished up Narcos when a trailer for Breaking Bad had started playing due to me staying on the ""Related Shows"" screen for too long. I never got the hype at first but I was curious. I hit the play button and it was all she wrote from that point on.I can talk about how well crafted the writing and how smooth the character development from this show is. I can go on about how beautiful the cinematography is, how it is able to transport us from the beautiful To'halijee desert the the dark mangy backdrop of a meth lab without skipping a beat. I can yap away about how every actor in this series-with series leads' Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn, particularly- being a living masterclass in their craft. I can talk you ear off about how this series is as addictive as the meth portrayed in here. But, alas, my words won't do this show any justice, no matter how much praise I give it.Do yourself a favor and watch this show. You will thank yourself for it. Or you may absolutely regret ever pressing play because you may find yourself completely glued to your T.V. and finding yourself unable to stop watching."
10,"For me Breaking Bad is not a show it is a feeling, an emotion every time i rewatch it instead of getting bored i get more excited instead sitting through it I watch every second of it feeling everything the characters feel every time I finish watching it I feel an emptiness that I have never felt in my real life so how could this be a show how could I be so connected to something that is not real well to me it is real to me it is an emotion."
10,This is officially the best tv show I've seen in my life. It's incredible how with each season this show gets better and better until season 5 which I think is the best one. Every person in the world should watch this masterpiece.
10,"Undoubtedly the best TV series ever. There haven't ever been anything better on TV. And those who mention GoT or Lost even in the same sentence, don't be ridiculous. Breaking Bad is so out of their league."
10,I binged watched this series last year and never felt outdated. Brilliantly penned by Vince Gilligan. Jesse pinkman and hank are two characters I liked a lot. Hank was the true protagonist in this anti hero series. 10/10 recommend if you haven't watched it yet
10,"From first episode to last episode its brilliant , brilliant and brilliant. only drawback of this show is that, it has ended, i hope it never ends."
9,"Now let's get one thing straight; this is a television program NOT for the faint at heart. If you like your viewing saccharine, with easy answers and everything wrapped up and snapped back to the beginning by the end of the episode, Breaking Bad is not for you. The premise alone should be enough to tell you that; a cancer-stricken father who is a chemistry teacher turns to illegal drug manufacture with a not-too-bright ex-student and struggles with his own mortality and morality along the way, doing his best to hide the new career choice from his pregnant wife, son with cerebal palsy, medic sister-in-law and law enforcer brother. Yes, this isn't light-weight material by any means.I'm not a fan of these shows that rely on ""inflated sense of tension"" to pump up the viewer's adrenaline levels while covering for poor scripting; stuff like 24, Lost and Prison Break started out well-enough but quickly descended into this cheap shock tactic approach to keep the audience hooked. Once I saw through this I stopped watching them completely and have been seeking out quality American shows that are well-produced and equally well-written, and I am happy to say that Breaking Bad is one of these.Bryan Cranston is perfectly cast as Walt, the man who has to make tough choices to provide for his family. He so perfectly becomes the character that it was not until later I realised he was previously cast as Hal in Malcolm In The Middle. His emotional range is staggering; with a few well-timed gestures or vocalisations he can convey several feelings at once, and when Walt is in pain it is completely believable. Walt is a man of few words, but chooses these words very carefully, so when he speaks everyone on-screen and in the audience are listening.Cranston isn't just carrying passengers though; he's ably supported by Anna Gunn as his wife Skylar, who brings just the right amount of care and concern for her husband and baby as needed and RJ Mitte plays the son who has CP and gives a very accurate, non-condescending portrayal of the condition so different from the ham-handed ""sympathy ploy"" approach so overused by shows from the States. Dean Norris plays Walt's brother Hank, the all-American police officer who doesn't take any guff and flushes out drug dealers for a living, with his quirky kleptomaniac wife Marie (the lightest character in this show, amusingly) who is handled with panache by Betsy Brandt. Rounding out the main cast is Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, every inch the nervy, paranoid and streetwise ""cook"" who becomes Walt's new partner and guide to the world of drug trafficking.There's much to recommend. Tight, well-plotted scripts that make the unbelievable tangible and don't waste a line while doing so. Superb, inventive direction and settings that perfectly fit the mood of the show, an interesting mixture of steadicam, handicam, point-of-view and camcorder shots that appear to be captured by the cast themselves. Excellent choice of soundtrack; almost every episode ends with a classic song and the musical cues throughout really add to the atmosphere without becoming overpowering; witness the searing, high-pitched noises when we see through Walt's eyes as he is in pain or being given bad news for an example.What is most remarkable is that the show never gives easy answers, never biases us towards the characters (we are given both sides of the debate and left to make our own choices, which respects the viewers intelligence) and always does things that you will not expect. There is not a single cliché to be found here, no way of knowing exactly how each person will react to the situations they are thrust into. These are complex, multi-faceted individuals with free will and their own motivations, who exist not as mere tools to advance the plot. The plot itself is always coherent and leaves very few loose ends. If you see an event or object framed, however subtlety, you can bet it will come back later on. Maybe not in the same episode, but as part of the story arc. And last but not least is the incredibly pitch black humour that crops up every now and then, so dark it almost feels uncomfortable to laugh.If you liked the first season of Dexter but don't like the direction it has now, Breaking Bad is for you. Not since I saw Firefly (a very different kind of show) have I enjoyed a television program this much. If they can carry this program on for two or three more seasons and then end it without dragging past the logical closure point - and with Walt the way he is, this is crucial - it will be one of the greatest drama series of all time.If you haven't tried it, start from the pilot episode, keep an open mind, and you just might find your new favourite show. I know I did."
10,"Thanks to netflix and vudu, I've just spent the last three weeks getting up to speed on all currently available mind-blowing episodes of what has to be the most lethally addictive, stunningly compelling, brilliantly written and performed non-major-network television series in the history of the medium.With Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan and Co. demonstrate what television actually can be; to say it's ground-breaking entertainment is a deplorable understatement. Each and every episode of the fifty four that have been released thus far - with the last eight to start filming next month and set to air in the summer of 2013 - have left me wanting more, craving more, like an addict. One night I watched six at one time, should've been heading to bed after the third but instead I found myself hitting 'play next episode' until I'd finished the last one of that season.It's all been said already, of course - the staggeringly genius performance of Cranston as Walter White and his slow, magnificently staged transformation into Heisenberg (at this point I call him WaltHeisen), the also magnificent performances from everyone else in the cast, the sheer dazzlingness of the writing, the direction, the photography. . .Everything about the show is perfection incarnate. I especially love how they don't start the episodes off with 'Previously on Breaking Bad. . .' but rather they use the far more effective method of an opening scene, followed by the Breaking Bad music and title sequence. Sometimes the scene (particularly in the earlier episodes, from season one) picks up right where the last one left off but most often, it's a teaser scene, which ties in with something later in the episode or in a different one altogether, like with season five starting off with WaltHeisen 'celebrating' his fifty second birthday in the diner, but eight episodes later, in the half-season cliff-hanger (with the cleverly-titled Walt Whitman poetry line Gliding Over All), WaltHeisen is still fifty one. The ultimate teaser, morbid shades of things to come. Absolutely cannot freakin' wait - another deplorable understatement."
10,"10/10, hands down. Objectively and subjectively a great show. It's #1 on my personal list - over South Park, X-Files, Friends, and Cheers.I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece, so I'll just say that the characters, story, and overall premise and writing are completely masterfully produced.Breaking Bad will be remembered as a timeless classic."
9,"Breaking Bad, the definition of good TV.From the first chapter to the last there is a story well told.I finished watching it for the second time and it still seems like one of the best series I've ever seen, I would see it for the third, fourth and even a fifth time and I would never get tired of watching it."
10,"To date, this is the only show that not only never falters in quality, but is consistently fantastic for all five seasons. It deserves all the praise it gets and more. It holds the title of my favorite show with an iron grip and won't let go any time soon."
10,"Perfect on every single level. Character development, storyline, pace, all of it. And absolutely iconic show. The high water mark of television, to this day. It really helped that they had a plan from the beginning on where they wanted to take the show."
10,"For the longest time I've heard how Breaking Bad is one of, if not, the best TV show to ever exist. After finally seeing it for the first time, I can agree.Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a chemistry teacher who get diagnosed with cancer and decides to manufacture and sell methamphetamine in order to provide for his family.I know I'm extremely late to this series but I finally got the chance to watch it and binged through it in about ten days because of how much I loved it. It's very rare for a TV show to completely hook you throughout but Breaking Bad is one of the few shows that manages to do it. To make over fifty hours of entertaining television is a very difficult task but what Vince Gilligan and his team of writers were able to do is truly astounding. I don't think there is a single weak episode in this series as Gilligan and his team try to make the most out of each one whether it's to develop characters or raise the stakes, there is always something that kept me engaged and wanting to watch the next episode. Seasons 4 and 5 were my favourite as that's when it really got intense and ended in a manner that made sense and felt satisfying. Seasons 1 and 3 were also fantastic as they built and set up the characters and intensity for the next two seasons. Season 2 is the weakest in my opinion as it sets up something interesting for the season finale but after finding out what it was, I did feel slightly underwhelmed. Apart from this one issue, the rest of the show is pretty much perfect.The writing is consistently fantastic. There are some very funny moments but that doesn't take away from the overall serious tone of the show. The world of Breaking Bad is so grounded and its realistic nature made all the events and situations feel believable to me. The writing is solid but it's also the acting that really elevates the material. Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen an actor give. It's mindblowing to see how his character transforms by the end and he brings so much to that transformation. Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is another standout. Again, an actor that brought so many memorable moments in the show and conveyed every emotion necessary to the best of his ability. Anna Gunn is spectacular as Skyler. There are various emotional scenes where she truly excelled in. Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman makes for the show's funniest moments. Dean Norris as Hank Schrader is very likeable and fun to watch. The rest of the cast also bring their A game to this insanely good show.Breaking Bad is one of my favourite shows of all time. It's a story that's simple but Vince Gilligan and his team add so many layers to it that make the final product unforgettable and a staggering feat. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, definitely give it a watch as I believe it's a show that's worth your time."
10,Out of all the shows that came out from 2008 till now this is the best of them all.
10,"What a show breaking bad is. every season is a masterpiece and is amazing. the acting, directing, character development, plot everything is simply amazing. walter white is possibly the best tv character of all time."
10,"This is it. This is the peak of television, nay, this is the peak of the entire film industry. Never will there be anything like Breaking Bad on the screen ever again. It is to this day, and always will be, the best Tv-series of all time.I could go into detail about all the things that are good with this show, but I fear then this review would be endless. But the most astonishing thing about Breaking Bad is its attention to detail. The creators, writers, and directors are pure geniuses, how they can even come up with all these impregnated details and foreshadowings is beyond me. As astonishing is the acting, from Giancarlo Esposito and Byran Cranston to Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn, every single performance is spot on, and Cranston's is out of this world - more than deservedly winning him 4 Emmy's and a Golden Globe.To spot flaws in this series, one would need an electron microscope. I'm not even sure then if you could find any. It is like the Mona Lisa of Tv - infact, the Louvre should replace her with a painting of Walter White. Flawless, absolutely flawless, I cannot put into words how good this show is.Everyone who hasn't seen this, must see it before they die.Everyone who has seen it - watch it again."
9,"I had heard a lot about this series, but somehow I found neither time nor ardor for watching it - several seasons, unknown actors to me, ambivalent topic... But recently, thanks to digital media opportunities, I took and watched all seasons in a succession - and I am glad I did so, as abstracts and flashbacks are not of much help if you have missed something, the contents is often sophisticated and versatile.Season 1 was ambiguous to me, mostly due to the drug issue and the fact that Bryan Cranston reminded me strongly of Cary Oldman whom I like a lot, but then I found me chuckling in many scenes and I realized that I was watching a good black comedy (well, in later seasons, the number of those moments decreased), I got used to the actors and started to like them (particularly Cranston, RJ Mitte, Giancarlo Esposito), paid attention to skillful cinematography, musical background, crazy composition of events and scenes... Moreover, I noticed that the so-called good guys behaved often in an unpleasant manner, and I tend to forget that running drug business in nasty and lethal. I also obtained additional chemistry knowledge but I can promise I will never use it for criminal purposes :) All in all, it is a very good series, although not on my very top where 24, Sherlock Holmes and several Scandinavian crime series (e.g. Bron/Broen) are placed. Or perhaps I have not used to the creations were de facto criminals are more pleasant and elaborated than decent citizens; but I might change my views as I have begun to watch Dexter..."
10,NO ONE can beat this tv show.Every character takes place in your heart especially jesse.Every character buidup is very good.And last three episodes are mind-blowing
10,"I would say the first season is not very catchy, it is a bit boring, but it is totally necessary for the development of the series. Each season increases the intensity and the desire to see more. I don't know anyone who has seen this series and was not amazed. Extraordinary performances by the entire cast."
10,"This show is absolutely outstanding! It's quickly become one of my all time favorites, I only remember Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the middle and am fairly shocked by how different he is. He goes from being a completely convincing suburbanite teacher to a completely believable villain without betraying the character. At times he looks completely menacing which is probably what makes the show work because his character really isn't that way. It's actually a rush at times watching the show because he's so good at sucking you into the world. There's no point in reading reviews for this show, just start watching it, you won't be able to stop."
10,"In my opinion, and many others as well, this is the best show ever created. I think it will be a long time until we have a show that maintains this level of quality and realism from the first to the last episode. The way it builds momentum and connects puzzle pieces is unlike any other show I have seen, and every time I rewatch I find another reason its so highly rated. So many of these characters have a brilliant arc that makes them so real and easy to connect with. Vince Gilligan is so good at presenting something in a casual way that seems irrelevant, but could actually be an enormous plot point later down the line. And because these things are done in such a realistic way, they go right over your head, until Vince is ready to pull them back into play."
10,"What an emotional rollercoaster. Episode after episode there are moments that hit hard. The characters are so real that you forget they are fictional. The actors aren't acting the characters, they are the character. This is the best TV show ever made and hasn't been surpassed to this day."
4,"I finished the very last episode (""felina"") today and felt a sort of disappointment - I was hoping that this critically acclaimed ""best show of all time"" would get better, turn into the masterpiece that everyone seems to consider it, at some point become interesting, or, at the very least, worthy of my time... it did not.At no point was I invested in anything going on. Never did the show manage to lure me in, make me care about anyone. There were no interesting characters whatsoever (Except for maybe Saul Goodman, but he was hardly the main character) - sure, it packed a bunch of great performances, the actors honestly did a truly good job, but what's the point when the script is so devoid of character, boring and hopelessly uninteresting. The show might be considered a good character study - Walt's descent into this becoming a nigh-monster who will stoop to some extremely despicable things is somewhat eye-catching, but this could have worked as a movie, maybe even a one-season show, but as it is, breaking bad is simply too pointless, boring and devoid of any sort of charm to be considered a good show."
9,Love it or hate it you can't put something less than 10 star to this show
10,"I cannot find words to tell you all how perfect this show is, but all I can say is that there will be none other that can beat this perfect TV show. Breaking Bad deserves all the hype it gets, Vince Gillian truly delivers to the viewers. You will laugh, cry, and your jaw will be dropped to the floor at how shocking it can get. I get how I'm posting this in 2017, but this show will go down in history for being one of the best shows ever. If you haven't seen it, you NEED to see it right now, I can guarantee you that when you finish the show you will NOT regret it. AND, the 3rd to last episode of the series is the only 10/10 to ever make IMDb, so that should explain itself. WATCH IT!"
10,"This series is the pinnacle of characterizations, the way it was written, made and performed is just matchless, flawless and it's far ahead from the perfection. You just need patience upto 2 seasons and the rest is an unforgettable journey. Don't miss."
10,"The show is perfect, every episode is perfect, from the beginning to the end. (yes, I like the ""fly"" episode).Breaking bad is a long and perfectly written story, with deep characters, and very well talented actors. You should watch it right now."
10,Nobody can say that game of thrones is betterJust look at season 8What a jokeBreaking bad WON and will be the most loved show ever
10,"Since everyone know how good this show is, i just want to write this review for the application the show.To me it perfect, its the best , and whenever I think of a greatest show ever, this one come to mind."
5,"People are STILL talking about Breaking Bad, long after the series finale, and I just wanted to write a bad review partly out of spite, but mostly out of confusion. I'm confused by the seemingly universal love for this show... I'm a big film/television fan, and I love large-scale, epic drama more than my own mother, but Breaking Bad just never really did it for me. I have watched every episode of Game of Thrones at least 4 times, and I could watch them again without nodding off once, but I struggled to make it through a season of BB spread out over the course of a month. It became a chore to watch it, like it was obligatory.I will give credit where it's due, and say that Bryan Cranston gave a phenomenal performance.That being said, outstanding performances are in no short supply in television these days, and they can be found in series that are - wait for it - more original. Yes, this series is praised for its originality, but the ""middle class parent turned drug dealer"" bit has been done before. Granted, not to the scale of BB, but the premise IS unoriginal."
10,"""BREAKING BAD"" is an experience, not a show. You live this series, you don't watch it. I can't say any of the characters' names without an awe-filled ""ahh"" before them. ""Ahh... Walt..."" ""Ahh... Gus..."" and so on. ""BREAKING BAD"" is transcendent."
10,"The sudden change of a common man. Walter White, placid high school teacher, was taken ill with an incurable disease. Turns out not to have anything to lose by becoming a drug dealer to ensure a bright future for his family.Breaking Bad is without a doubt the most realistic, vivid, perfectly executed, psychedelic, brilliant, Mind Blowing, Stunning Comedy-Drama Series ever!!! It beats even Twin Peaks and I am a huge D.Lynch fan imagine that! Bryan Cranston is a hell of an actor, he deserves to be crowned in the Hollywood firmament and Vince Gilligan is a visionary genius. Masterpiece."
10,"If I had to characterize Breaking Bad in comparison to other high-quality TV shows, I would call it ""the show that never did anything wrong"". BrBa has a flawless storyarc, which neatly connects the first episode of season 1 with the final episode of season 5. The ending of the series, which has often been the weak point of many other great shows, feels almost inevitable - as many great endings in literature also do.There is so much to be praised about this show. What impressed me most was perhaps the attention to detail. This is also the show where no loose end was ever forgotten - and, if not tied up, it would usually come back to haunt Walter White or some other character. There is also a strong sense of fate or even karma in this show - at one point literally hitting the protagonist out of the blue sky (if you have seen the show, you understand the reference). Walter White's cancer in the end becomes a metaphor for his own malice, that is slowly metastasizing in his soul. In the end, the philosophical question is whether one becomes bad because of one's deeds (while continuously rationalizing them as necessary and inevitable) or whether one does bad things because it is already part of one's character. The title, ""Breaking Bad"", seems to point towards the latter, whereas the ending of the show rather points towards the former.The show often uses metaphor and allusion - sometimes in a way that will only be noticed by the most attentive of observers. For example, the curious model of a car Walter drives has been known to be a ""underachiever"" with unrealized potential, much like his owner. Minor details like an unrepaired crack in a windshield or a rotting pizza on a roof are constant reminders of the sinister events that have seeped into the suburban lifestyle - and they are milestones of Walter's moral journey into darkness, until things are beyond repair. Keep in mind that this is the man who feels compelled to ""fix things"" like a random shaky table with a napkin, but who becomes so power-hungry that he eventually declares: ""I'm not in the money business. I'm not in the drug business. I'm in the empire business.""The psychology of Walter White would lend itself to filling pages, but the same could be said for many other characters. I will never look at harmless hobbies like rock-collecting in the same way again - and the color purple has also gained some unpleasant connotations. I have also learned that a Roomba cannot fix a broken home and childhood.Perhaps the last piece of praise: the whacky humor of the show. There were moments when I simply did not know whether I should laugh or cry (I will never be able to use an ATM without thinking of this show). BrBa also has it's very unique take on American consumer culture and middle class suburban lifestyle - there is a lot of brilliant social and political commentary in this show (which, by the way, has been further developed in ""Better Call Saul"").Altogther, this show is a nearly perfect package and incredibly well-crafted. Do not miss out!"
10,"Simply put, this show is excellent. If you haven't watched it, watch it. The story is excellent, the acting is excellent, the casting is excellent, the directing is excellent, the cinematography is excellent, the pacing is excellent and the characters are excellent."
10,"I absolutely looooved this series!!!! GOT is my number one but this is a very tight second...funny as heck many times, sad which could bring tears to your eyes, shocking scenes that get your blood pumping, and top of the line acting.. i mean, everyone was sooo awesome!Once again i was not thrilled about the ending.. in fact, i never wanted it to end...hahahhaa... but all good things come to an end. Where have all the great original writers gone now? Everything else is just the same old thing.. recreating whats already been done.Come on original writers, come back! We are desperate for something good while we come home from a hard days work and just want to forget the worlds craziness and enjoy real content!! We miss you. Why isnt my review showing??"
10,"If you asked me prior to April 2019 to pit the two most critically acclaimed TV series against each other - as fair or unfair as it is based on the fact that they are two completely different shows, but if you boiled it down to the basics I would've told you that Game of Thrones was ever-so-slightly better than Breaking Bad...the former has some complexities and ""holy *four letter word*"" moments that are just unmatched by anything I've ever watched. And I may be one of the few that did not mind the last season of GoT and it's resolution, but also agree with the masses in the decline in quality and nuance (what both shows are notorious for) of GoT's last season, couple with a fair amount of wasted potential and forgone character development in the last season. I think we all are guilty of coming up with our own intermediate/extended scenes in our minds to satisfy or complement what we saw on the actual TV screen.Thus, now that both shows are done the real winner is very apparent: Breaking Bad emerges victorious from the battle.From start to finish, BB is as close to perfection as any piece of media can get. Everyone knows the story, but I will never forget how absolutely intense, stunning, and at times anxiety-inducing the experience of watching this show was (I binged it very shortly after the finale since everyone was absolutely freaking out about how good it was). It balances every character and everything good about the crime/drama genre coupled with an amazingly unique premise that almost demands tension at any given moment.Acting...directing...cinematography...editing... and above all, writing...all literally 100% on point, all the time. Including the resolution/finale. No wishing for something different or character arc ambiguity. It was sensical, shocking, and satisfactory to the highest degree.Both GoT and BB have raised the bar for TV that was already elevated by shows like The Sopranos and The Wire. Some current ones are close (check out Barry for some awesome and unique black comedy, and clearly takes some cues from BB) but will be hard pressed to find something as magical as Breaking Bad - the closest we will get is its counterpart show Better Call Saul, which is also damn near perfect (come or with Season 5 already, dammit!)Go Team Gilligan - I am waiting for your next project!"
10,"Just perfect, fantastic , must watch.Disappionted when i watched the movie El Camino...missed Mr WhiteThe best of all"
10,Other people have written much about the characters in the show so it doesn't require me to add to that.However Breaking Bad has some of the cleverest writing I have ever encountered in the making of a television show. The twist and turns of the story over so many seasons are outstanding.To any budding script writers this is a almost perfect example of how to write a script.
9,Best drama series ever made!!!hats off to all team behind breaking bad
9,"RATED 9/10Language: EnglishSource: NetflixRECOMMENDEDThis is well played game. The protagonist transformation and the situations are really awesome. Some cooked decisions are mind blowing one. The best one is ""this is not Meth"".Really enjoyed and wanted more on the last season... They balanced the thrill and family sentiment perfectly...The negative side is that some episodes really tested the patience like ""the fly"", even though they gave the reason. Also the the family sentiment and husband and wife moral contradiction was too much and repeated towards the end of the series...I liked the ending and still haunting."
3,In my personal opinion this series is higly overrated. The first three season are one of most boring thing i've seen.
10,"Hands down best drama tv series ever. If you disagree, you are wrong. Stiry and character arcs are perfect."
2,"When I read the synopsis a few years ago, already I felt that the storyline lacked interest for me and did not watch any of the series. Then recently some friends were so enthusiastic about the series that I finally got started on it.So I watched all of episode 1 series 1 and then reflected. Now, it is not as if I am the kind of person who has trouble finding things funny that other people do. But I would say that let's say only half of the material out there that people will find funny will affect me that way. However, this material failed continuously to amuse or excite me in any way except for the suspense of the opening scene not being resolved until late in the episode.I think of the first episode of a series as the pilot - therefore it sets the level of interest for an entire series. Which meant that after that I simply gave up on the whole series.So what went wrong? Although jokes are never funny when explained, there exists an anatomy of humour that one can correlate to any given snippet. The general profile of something funny is that it has some element of surprise - it builds up a picture and the moment of laughter is when the viewer or reader is forced suddenly to see things another way. And generally that other way has to have a level of originality for the effect to work.So I think the problem actually lies in the construction of the screenplay. As much as the ideas appear to be original, they do not unfold in a way that produces the comic effect. Nor therefore is there much occasion of suspense.So for me the real question is why do so many people find it funny? I think that for me will remain a mystery."
9,"I am not even at 5th season, but let me say till now this has won my heart.First 2 seasons took 9 months to me but now gave a change and now I regret why did I give up.My rating might go up as expectation, let me see the 5th season."
10,10/10 fantastic tv show would highly recommend to watch
10,"Okay many of you must have read all the reviews, so I will skip that part. I came here to say that I totally LOVE the show!And the ending always makes me emotional and that song 'Baby Blue' is a perfect song for the finale ending!GUESS I GOT WHAT I DESERVED..."
10,"OK, we all know the synopsis: gifted but henpecked high school chemistry teacher gets lung cancer and decides to cook world class meth, hijinks ensue. But it's much more than that.The show is written VERY realistically. Because Walt starts out as such a real human being, in every scene, in every episode, right to the end, the viewer finds him or herself asking, ""What would I do in the same situation?"" No other show has managed to do that.And as the show goes on, one's answers diverge more and more because we're less in Walt's position with every episode. How would a normal person go about making and selling drugs without getting caught? What would we do when our competition came to kill us? Those may be pretty simple. But what would we do when our loved ones found out, and keeping it quiet meant harming them, for whom, we tell ourselves, we have taken all this risk in the first place?They say there are only seven basic plots, and America's clear favorite is ""overcoming the monster,"" but this is not that kind of story. It's a ""tragedy"" much like the greatest story ever told: The Iliad, and it has elements of a dark comedy in it. Walt is Achilleus. Gus is Hektor. The DEA and APD are the gods, not knowing who to help and where to strike, and not entirely good guys in any case. The intelligent viewer will go from rooting for Walt to hating him just slightly less than his enemies. The less intelligent viewer will go from loving Walt to merely hating his shrewish but sensible wife. But all will enjoy the show. Buckle up for the ride of your life."
10,"This show just gets better by the episode. A masterpiece truly. The performances are simply astonishing, outstanding, it totally made me binge watch from the very beginning, totally a MUST WATCH!"
10,"Prison Break and GOT is a joke compared to this one. It had everything: Insane acting, Great story, Killing, brutal scenes, you name it. It was so addicting I couldnt stop watch it! I almost never ate or slept! I re-watched it once and it was just as good as the first time! actually I could re-watch it 10 times more if I had the time. 2008 what a great year!"
10,Breaking bad is the most consistent tv show I've watched. Vince Gilligans writing is absolutely incredible. I could probably watch this for the rest of my life and not be disappointed. The cinematography is possibly the greatest advancement in the whole world.I would recommend this to anyone looking for an amazing show. The only thing that is missing is nothing.
10,"I am rewatching this series almost 10 years later when it ended and it still is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The script, acting, direction, storytelling, and character development are excellent. The script is intelligent without being pretentious or overbearing. I have rarely seen any shows that can compare in being consistently strong throughout each season and then just ending gloriously. This series is within top 3 of all time for me."
10,"Breaking bad was one of the best written shows ever from character development to suspense, the first three seasons are very slow burning and great then the final half of the series goes insane with tension fire fights betrayals that all lead to an amazing unforgettable conclusion and a truly epic finale"
2,"....you like the first few episodes. If you do, then great. If you don't, you will do what I did and waste a lot of time going through some tedious and mind numbing TV, constantly waiting for it to get better. It didn't for me. I didn't like any characters, the pace was painfully slow at times, episodes can be missed entirely and no one would care (fly!), and there was a lot of filler. I will say, the way it ended was excellent, but not enough for me to recommend sitting through series 1-4 to watch it"
10,"Late to witness it, and u regret it.Well i quit gym for this whole week to complete it, among going to office and all I only got few hourse which i spent on it. Quite addictive. Character of Walter White will be remembey whole life.It affects you personally.It is entertaining , exciting and interesting every episode that you wanna spend your whole day on it. Performances and some dialogues are top notch. Screenplay is brilliant. Don't miss this at all."
10,"By around 2008, two things had occurred: Hollywood had run out of any original ideas (see the 1990's movies) and crystal meth had popularly become a known drug for many people, replacing cocaine and other preferences. Most people did not get into it, but everyone had heard stories about common suburban professionals who were hooked on meth.But Breaking Bad was far from a simplistic take on the subject matter, and it never lowered its ambitions in telling its story. Instead, it went well beyond what it needed to do in order to delve into the subject matter. It dissected the life of a middle aged underachieving man, who despite his brilliance and resume, was stuck in suburban life- a victim of a horrible economy and cutthroat corporate business ambitions, mixed with his own naivety on the subject (after all not all chemistry geniuses especially those not born into wealth totally understand the business world while in graduate school).Breaking Bad nails the catalysts and nuances of how someone can turn from a law abiding citizen into a mastermind criminal just by a simple flick of the switch (which in this case is the soul). Any intelligent person knows what they are capable of doing, however immoral or illegal, but it is only their soul that is keeping them in tact from crossing the line into criminality, especially in a situation where they have been wronged or ripped off by other immoral or criminal people. For we know, nothing in life is guaranteed and hardship for most people is just around the corner in one form or another. This is where Breaking Bad excels; it dissects the morality of society in a realistic way where the viewer sees that everyone is guilty in one way or another and is at some moral or criminal culpability, whilst the antihero, supposedly portrayed as the bad guy is a victim of their selfishness, greed, ignorance, and snobbery.Hence, Breaking Bad paints a picture that may hit too close to home for the untruthful. In almost every character, the viewer sees a piece of either themselves or someone they know or have met, and how they snake their way through society to ravage others around them in order to get ahead. Ultimately, the show whether purposely or inadvertently created an abstract measuring scale of morality, where the assumedly ""good"" people may wind up at the top, and the assumedly ""bad"" people may wind up as their victims on the bottom.This makes intelligent viewers question their own morality, their view of the world and society, and it reinforces their perspectives on truth in an increasingly grey world when it comes to virtues."
8,"An interesting and unusual series whose main strength is thedevelopment of the characters.An atmospheric and sometimes bizarre series with brilliantlywritten characters.The cast is good, and Bryan Cranston is great in the role of Walter White.The complicated, layered characters are the greatest strength of thisimpressive series.A fun, interesting, tense and a bit bizarre series worth watching."
3,"Breaking Bad is one of the most important series in history, acting is awesome but the story is so boring!! I'm sorry but that's my opinion."
10,The best show ever made. Thank you everyone who gives us this epic series
10,"What more can I say but absolutely brilliant it has just about every emotion you can think of. The script is outstanding, the characters are believable. You empathize, sympathize, laugh, cry. Anyone who doesn't give this a Ten what more do you want."
10,"I don't think that there will be series in the level of breaking bad...It is mysterious, has incredible actors and epic story. it is recommended for everybody"
10,"I get the Bluray's out and watch this series every year or two and it's truly held up to the test of time. It takes us on the path of a mild-mannered chemistry teacher and let's us watch him become a monster who kills everyone who gets in his way. One has to wonder how many monsters start out this way. The beaten down nobody who finally gets power and abuses it. It's a truly great series when you take it that way. And I'm giving it a 10 rating as a whole. But not every episode is a 10. Some episodes are dogs. You have to take it as a whole. Because, realistically, someone could watch a single episode and say 'this sucks'. And they would be right. But it's necessary to see the good AND BAD when building character development. That's why I think the series deserves a 10 rating. Devote enough time to binge a season at a time and you won't be disappointed!"
10,No television program will ever top this. Every single thing about this show is pure perfection. I wish I could wipe my memory and watch this show for the first time all over again.
10,"After i finished watching this masterpiece since 2020 i watched a lot of series but i'm still very convinced THERE'S NOTHING can be great as BB i don't think there will be anything like it in the future , characters , acting , script , and especially ending , some people thinks the first seasons are not that great but when you finish watching everything you will release what first seasons were about , watch it guys you won't regret it, hope you enjoy it and you will."
10,"I very rarely write reviews on here as I never feel the need, but I have to say something about Breaking Bad, having just watched the entire 5 seasons. Well, there is no more to be said that hasn't already been said about this show. The only thing that I find disappointing about Breaking Bad is that it hasn't achieved a 10/10 rating on IMDb. I would be very interested to meet the people who can give this show anything less than a 10 rating. I mean, how good can a TV show be? I watched the entire series over a two week period, sometimes not getting to bed until 3am, and not through choice... i really need my sleep. Breaking Bad was my world for those few weeks. This show could be unsurpassable."
10,"Alongside lost, my favorite television series of all time."
5,"To be honest I liked only the last season. The plot is so obvious. I also don't like the characters, Walter's evolution is incredible but the character is so hateful!! Jesse is so stupid and Skyler is annoyng."
10,"One of the best series to be ever made for TV. This drama made with a calculated budget unlike game of thrones was never boring. Kudos for the great story by Vince Gilligan. By the time i finished the final episode i am spell bound. The camera work, music, editing and what not - everything worked for breaking bad. Walter played by Bryan Cranston will make you feel for him and at times will even turn you bad. He blurs the line between good and bad. The script is so solid that you can hardly find loopholes in any episode. All your feelings, emotions, attitude are brought to life by this guy. Watch the series to understand what it is to be alive. Don't miss this one."
10,No doubt totally worth watching. The first season is slow..but later u will enjoy the slowness.
10,"Breaking Bad is one of the great TV shows of our generation. It offers a compelling concept mixed with incredible characters that are layered beyond comprehension. With excellent music, cinematography and atmosphere, this show cements itself as being worth its praise."
10,"This is the best series I have ever watched. It is perfectly written. The tension is spot on and it has meaningful substance. A lot of show writers can learn from this show. It's just impressive. Give it a chance and you'll see what everyone else is talking about.Honestly... if you don't think this is a fantastically well written show then you have horrible horrible taste in television quality period. I completely understand everyone has their own opinions but I draw the line when it comes to Breaking Bad when someone tells me it's ""boring"" or ""overrated"". How someone can write a bad review on this show is beyond my understanding. It's literally the best goddamn show I have ever watched. And I've finished a lot of shows in my down time. They couldn't have ended it any more brilliantly. Especially after all that amazing build up."
10,"The arc of this character--series creator Vince Gilligan's invention of Walter White as a sick soul--is, it's clear now. One of the great narratives in Television history. Breaking Bad was a radical type of television, and also a very strange kind of must-watch: a show that you dread and crave at the same time. A show that managed year after year to accomplish that rare blend of Hollywood darling and fan favorite All the characters are written in a complex, deep and fascinating way. Series creator Vince Gilligan is a pure uncut genius and it shows behind and In front of the camera. Season 5 stands to up the ante more than any one prior, with fantastic twists, incredibly tense moments, more great standout music to fit the scenes properly, and acting that can't be beat. I came out of season 4 saying that there was no way to top the amazing conclusion to one of the greatest television seasons ever, but they have seemed to manage just that. Without giving too much away, relationships are tested, characters die, new bonds form, and more meth is cooked. I think it should be a crime to not watch this show, maybe equal to cooking meth with the intent to distribute. This series is an absolute masterpiece. It is a work of art! If We had a chance to send a capsule of earths most important items to another planet, this series would have to be included! Not only did this show break bad but it broke the type of medium of television beyond the pit of mediocrity it usually resides in. It may be awhile for which a show of this caliber comes along, maybe once in a life time. This is a series that I will always cherish, and not just for the obvious reasons like the superb acting and the high stakes narrative -- but also for the fact that it gave me hope for the future of television, and the media's potential overall, to serve as a platform for talented writers and actors who actually have something inspired to say about the world we live in. Walter white is perhaps tvs best anti hero that you will feel dirty even rooting for till the very end, and what a perfect ending it is! This show has so much material that it gave birth to the brilliant prequel Better Call Saul. if you haven't had the privilege of seeing televisions arguably best of all time, congrats because you're about to embark on a journey like no other! You will wind up making 99% pure crystal blue meth and demand everyone call you Heisenberg. But seriously, you now have 5 seasons to binge watch on Netflix. I envy you!"
10,"We really are going to be talking about this show for the rest of our lives aren't we.Breaking Bad really is something else, I never watched it in full until last year, probably for the best because there were so many cruel cliffhangers in the show, one in particular lasting for almost a year, the show really likes playing cruel games with the viewer and I like that. Something that Breaking Bad is really good at is that it made me care about the characters on a level that very few shows or movies have. There really isn't that many other shows where I would question so many variable and possible outcomes for Walt and his realationships, just how many possible ways a scenario would play out or the consequesnces of every action or how differently something would have played out. Hardly any shows would make me even care about something like that at all.The world and characters this show has created is so layered yet believable in its setting of Albuquerque and makes you feel like you're really there with the characters. Every plot point and emotion delivered perfectly. Some people say that it is too drawn out but i think the pacing of the show and story was just right. Everything that happened or was focused upon in Breaking Bad's overall arcs and story all had a purpose and payoff for being there. Every character and situation you care about, and every following season raising the stakes and more tense and enthralling than the last. It also has probably the most emotionally explosive and intense final season in television history, but I'll let you be judge of thatEveryone should see it. Every actors performance was spot on and I hope Vince Gillian never stops writing for Film and Television."
10,"Well, What can I say about this amazing TV series? It is just the best series I have ever seen. I miss Walter White and Jesse Pinkman...The first season is really good, because Walter is worried about his life and what he is going to do after the news about the cancer.The second and third seasons they keep very good, but I think that the fact of Walter want to forget the idea to cook meth and turn back all the time is a little tiring...The fourth season is probably the most moment awaited of all the series. Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring made a great performance and he really looks like a two-faces man. And you never know what he is going to do. The last episode of fourth season is one of the best, but the fans knew that this amazing series couldn't finish like that.And then, the amazing, unbelievable, incredible and wonderful fifth season came! I don't have enough words to describe this season. Since the first episode and then after each episode it was getting more tense and I had to watch almost the entire season in one or two days.Hank was a very nice character and all the audience liked him. The same for Mike and Saul... Great job guys!The last episode is crazy man... First, I would like to say that the soundtrack chosen was amazing. Baby Blue for who want to check it out.I think the last scene of that series was perfect and I wouldn't do nothing different. The upshot for Walter and Jesse was worthy.I watched the documentary about the last season and there was a really good environment. When each character made the last scene, they won a picture with autograph by all the team. Sometimes it was very emotional and Bryan Cranston is the funny guy I ever have seen.Congratulations and thank you for this series. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is the best TV series pair."
10,This is literally the greatest show of all time. I won't be taking any questions at this time and if you disagree with me then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.
10,"This is a great show. First of all the look of the show is just absolutely outstanding. It has this greenish-yellow tint to it that makes the desert scenes all the more gritty and hot. You can really feel the heat from those scenes. The acting is without question movie-quality. In fact, the whole show has this movie feel that can only be described as a mini-movie for TV (not a TV movie though). I love the fact the show perpetuates drama in the most ordinary circumstances. Only The Sopranos came close to the balance that Breaking Bad has with its story lines. Altogether, Breaking Bad is the next greatest thing to Meth!"
10,"I have always been a just & fair guy in all my dealings.I am a really soft spoken person who handles aggrevating situations with a massive smile on my face. London time 8:15am I just realized I haven't left a review for the only show truly worthy of being called a masterpiece.Let me assure you I am a really hard to please guy so much so it took over 7 years for family & friends to convince me to finally give Breaking Bad a go. When I got to season 5 I turned it off & decided to make some phone calls. I called four friends & two relatives. I told them off big time! Yes thats exactly what happened I said 'whats wrong with you people you said BB was good'. Upon which 3 of them replied 'ye...ya....ye'es?! AND?!' Then they heard the near impossible excitement in my voice. All I said was you guys kept saying its good but you should have used wordings like: best ever, incredible, a masterpiece, life changing, one of a kind, 100/10* etc etcThis show is so good there should be another list here for shows like these. Problem is this will be the only show in that special list as nothing even remotely comes close. And nothing ever will. Start to finish its simply extraordinary. A masterpiece. A stunning work of art.Everyone should watch it regardless of the genre preference. Trust me you'll be doing yourselves a favourPerfection on every level. Its madness because I literally struggle to watch many other shows. They just seem to lack what BB had. PerfectionIts not just a tv show its an opportunity. An opportunity to witness the greatest show ever crafted. Absolutely a must see!"
10,The greatest peice of television ever created and I think that says alot about this show.
10,"This is the only show i've seen and its extraordinary. Everything you would want from a show really, multiplied by 100."
10,"""Breaking Bad"" is a groundbreaking television series that redefined the crime drama genre and set a new standard for storytelling on the small screen. With its gripping narrative, impeccable character development, and flawless execution, it remains an absolute masterpiece.The show revolves around Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, and his former student, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul). As the duo delves deeper into the criminal underworld, we witness the transformation of these complex characters, their moral dilemmas, and the consequences of their choices.What sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart is its meticulous attention to detail. From the brilliant writing by creator Vince Gilligan to the exceptional performances by the entire cast, every aspect of the show is executed with precision. Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of extraordinary, as he flawlessly navigates the character's descent into darkness, showcasing both vulnerability and ruthlessness.""Breaking Bad"" is a must-watch series for any fan of quality television. Its compelling storytelling, outstanding performances, and thought-provoking themes make it a true modern classic that will continue to be celebrated for years to come."
9,"Breaking the old framework, the law and committing crimes to do crazy things that a dull person can't do. However, these things are just to continue the middle-class life of the family after death. The responsibility of rules and obligations is still deep in the marrow. How can we be a person who lives for ourselves, or how can we live?"
10,All i can say I can't get this movie out of my head! This movie just too good 👍🏻
10,"I watched this 1 year ago. And until this day I just can't get over it. I don't know how to describe that feeling where something is so good that you live in its universe and forget your own life while binge watching it, then once it's over you are like ""wth just happened??"" .. but yeah.. This series is amazing."
10,"Amazing. Fantastic. Wonderful. Dramatic. Intense. Terrific. Fabulous. Tremendous. I can't come up with enough adjectives to describe how great this show is. I didn't even know what it was about when I started watching it, which made it that much better. I started watching it on Netflix after the system hounded me endlessly to try it, and finished it on cable, since Netflix didn't have the last episodes.What's so great about it? BB is about family. It's about craziness. It's about corruption. It's about the love of money. It's about the contradiction between our public vs private personas. It's about fear, love, hate, happiness, sadness, and indifference. It's about conflicts, children, and the monotony of suburban existence. It's about being human. Everyone can relate to something in the show. Even if somehow you can't, it hooks you from the very start. This is coming from a person who is very picky about TV. I have never seen a show as awesome as this one. I urge you to give it a try."
10,The best series ever made! The script and the writing is outstanding! Bryan's and aaron's acting is out of this world. Vince Gilligan Thank you!
10,"Yeah... a masterpiece! If you never seen Breaking Bad... please, make yourself a favor, maratone this!"
7,"If i say that it was good , but not excellent , every fan will try to kill me , but it's my opinion"
10,"The best TV series ever created. Period. I have watched every episode 5 or 6 times and always discover something new with each viewing. This show is the gold standard against which everything else can be measured. In addition to perfect casting, directing, plot, and dialog, we have those magnificent POV camera shots and perfect music. It's been over a decade now, and I still can't believe how good this is. Overwhelming, breathtaking, groundbreaking, inventive, stunning, jaw dropping. Perfection."
10,I didn't watch this when it was on as a Dad I didn't want to see drugs or those who make them glorified. I was wrong and if your on the fence get off it and hit play this will go down as one of the greatest series in my lifetime.
10,Thanks to everyone worked in this show you made a great show in history
10,Story = 10/10Characters = 10/10Cinematography = 10/10Editing = 10/10Soundtracks = 10/10Everything just felt like a good dream.
